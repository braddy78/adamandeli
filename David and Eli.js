His eyes flickered across the screen, scanning profiles on the gainer dating site he had frequented for the past several months. The routine had become almost mechanical—filter, scroll, click, disappointment. He had been down this road too many times before. Countless messages exchanged, fleeting connections made, but none of the encounters ever lived up to the stories or promises made online. Some barely ate more than an average person at a buffet, while others claimed to have limitless appetites but tapped out after a few pizzas. David wasn’t looking for just anyone. He wanted someone exceptional—someone whose hunger seemed to defy nature. His fascination with gainers wasn’t new, but it had intensified over the years. He imagined hosting grand feasts, watching as his guest devoured everything he could prepare, the pile of empty plates growing until the food ran out. But that fantasy remained elusive. The site refreshed, and David sighed, leaning back in his chair. His finger hovered over the trackpad, ready to close the tab and abandon the search for the night. But then— A new profile appeared. The username was simple: <strong>Eli22</strong>. David clicked it without hesitation. The profile photo was of a slim young man with pale skin, tousled dark hair, and a faint smirk tugging at his lips. Eli’s bio was short but to the point: <em><strong>“I’m not like the others. Bottomless.”</strong></em> David’s heart skipped a beat. The simplicity of the message intrigued him. He scrolled further. No public eating photos, no flashy displays of gluttony—just a few ordinary pictures of Eli in oversized hoodies and sweatpants. His lean frame made the idea of such a claim seem almost absurd. Curiosity got the better of him. David typed out a brief message. David: Hey, I saw your profile. You say you’re bottomless? What does that mean? He hovered over the send button, hesitating for just a second before clicking it. The message marked as “sent” and David closed his laptop, assuming that like most nights, he wouldn’t hear anything back. But as he stood to head to the kitchen, his laptop chimed. A new message. Eli: It means exactly what it says. I can eat. A lot. David’s eyes widened. He sat back down. David: A lot like… how much? Eli: Enough to clean out your kitchen. Maybe more. David smiled to himself, his excitement growing. David: I’d like to see that. Eli: Tomorrow night?

The golden skin crackled faintly as he set it onto the counter. Alongside it, bowls of creamy mashed potatoes, freshly baked bread, and a plate of grilled vegetables waited, steam curling up invitingly. David took a step back, hands on his hips, scanning the table with satisfaction. It was more food than he typically made for guests, but after the conversation with Eli, he figured better safe than sorry. A sharp knock echoed through the apartment. Right on time. David wiped his hands on a towel and made his way to the door. When he opened it, he blinked twice, masking a flicker of surprise. Eli stood there, thin and small beneath an oversized hoodie that hung loosely over his frame. The sleeves extended just past his wrists, and the sweatpants he wore sagged slightly at the waist. David couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow. “You weren’t kidding about being slim,” David commented with a smirk, stepping aside. Eli’s lips twitched in amusement as he stepped inside. “It’s deceiving, I know.” David glanced him over again, shaking his head playfully. “I don’t know if I made enough after all.” Eli’s eyes flicked toward the kitchen, and David caught a glimpse of something predatory beneath his casual demeanor. “I’m sure you made plenty.” David chuckled, leading him to the dining table. “We’ll see about that.” They sat, and David began plating generous portions—two drumsticks, a heaping pile of mashed potatoes, and a thick slice of bread. He placed Eli’s plate in front of him, watching with curiosity. Eli didn’t hesitate. The first drumstick disappeared in three bites, bone stripped clean and placed neatly to the side. The second followed suit just as swiftly. The mashed potatoes, which David expected to take some effort, vanished in spoonfuls, as if Eli had been starving for days. David’s fork paused mid-air as he watched Eli tear through his plate, eyes narrowing slightly. “That was fast,” David remarked. Eli met his gaze, chewing the last piece of bread calmly. “I told you I was hungry.” David leaned back in his chair, still processing. “I can see that. I’ve barely touched my plate.” Eli licked a stray bit of butter from his thumb, glancing at the table. “You’re not finished yet, are you?” David raised an eyebrow, bemused. “No, but there’s more. Let me get it.” He retrieved the rest of the food from the counter—half the chicken, an untouched loaf of bread, and more potatoes. He set the serving dishes between them, expecting Eli to pace himself. Instead, Eli reached forward without hesitation, piling his plate high again. David watched as piece by piece, the meal disappeared. It was methodical, almost mesmerizing. The way Eli ate wasn’t rushed or messy, but each bite was purposeful, driven by a hunger that didn’t seem to fade. David’s eyes flickered to Eli’s stomach, which remained hidden beneath the folds of his hoodie, though the fabric seemed to sit a little tighter than before. “How are you even fitting all that?” David asked, only half-joking. Eli grinned, finishing the last bite of chicken. “Efficient packing.” David snorted, shaking his head. “Efficient or not, I think you’re on your way to clearing me out.” Eli’s gaze drifted toward the fridge. “Anything else left?” David laughed but noted the seriousness in Eli’s voice.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard, reluctant to let the conversation end. There was something captivating about Eli’s confidence, something that hinted at more beneath the surface. David: You’re not the first guy I’ve met who claimed to eat a lot. Most barely finish a couple of pizzas. He hesitated, wondering if the message sounded too dismissive. But his curiosity outweighed his doubt, and he hit send. The reply came faster than he expected. Eli: I’m not like them. David smirked to himself, leaning forward over his laptop. David: That’s what they all say. Eli: I don’t just say it. I mean it. David: So you can eat? Eli: A lot. David's eyes narrowed at the screen, the cursor blinking in silence as he waited. There was something almost playful in Eli’s short responses—confident but not bragging. David: How much is a lot? Eli: Enough. David felt a twinge of amusement and frustration at the vague reply. David: That’s not very convincing. Eli: Oh? Do you need proof? David’s fingers danced across the keyboard. David: Yeah. I’ve been burned before. A pause. Eli: Burned? David: Met up with a few “big eaters” who couldn’t finish more than a family-sized pizza. Eli: Sounds disappointing. David: You could say that. Eli: I won’t disappoint. David: You say that now, but… Eli: I could show you. David tilted his head, intrigued. David: Show me how? Eli: Would you rather see photos or a video?

But Eli’s eyes barely flickered in appreciation. Instead, he immediately grabbed the nearest loaf of bread, tearing it in half and cramming the pieces into his mouth like he hadn’t eaten in days. David took his seat slowly, watching in stunned silence as Eli devoured everything within arm’s reach. Chicken bones were stripped clean in seconds, potatoes scooped directly from the serving bowl, leaving nothing but traces of gravy in its wake. “You know,” David began cautiously, “I’ve never seen someone eat this much this fast.” Eli grinned around a mouthful of bread, swallowing hard. “You said to bring my appetite.” David laughed nervously. “Yeah, but this feels like feeding a black hole.” Eli merely shrugged, already reaching for the next plate. His belly, which had started out flat beneath the hoodie, gradually swelled with each passing minute. The hem of his sweatshirt lifted slightly, exposing the pale skin stretched taut around his growing midsection. David’s curiosity shifted to mild concern. “Uh… I can make more, but—” “Please,” Eli interrupted, fixing David with a look that was almost pleading. “Whatever you have left.” David hesitated for a moment before sighing and heading to the fridge. He pulled out whatever he could find—leftover pasta, frozen pizzas, even a full cake he had been saving for later in the week. He set it all down on the table, shaking his head. “You’re going to eat me out of house and home.” Eli didn’t respond. He was already digging in. By the time David finished half of his own plate, Eli had cleared not only the dinner but everything from the fridge as well. The shelves inside sat barren, save for a jar of mustard and an expired yogurt David had forgotten about. Eli leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. His belly pressed hard into the table’s edge, the hoodie barely clinging to him. The round curve protruded heavily into his lap, lifting his shirt enough to expose his navel. David crossed his arms, raising a brow. “Satisfied yet?” Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, glancing toward the pantry door. “Not quite.” David followed his gaze, chuckling in disbelief. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” “I’m serious,” Eli replied, standing with effort. His belly shifted outward, hanging slightly over the waistband of his sweatpants as he lumbered toward the pantry. David trailed after him, leaning in the doorway as Eli rifled through the shelves. Boxes of cereal, jars of pasta sauce, and canned goods began to vanish into his mouth. It wasn’t rushed or messy—each item simply disappeared with a few large bites. “That was a family-sized box,” David remarked as Eli finished the cereal. Eli shrugged, swallowing the last handful dry. “Family-sized for someone else.” The pantry, much like the fridge, was soon left bare. Eli stepped back into the kitchen, rubbing his exposed belly, which now resembled a large, round ball beneath his stretched hoodie. He turned toward the sink, eyes narrowing. “I need something to drink,” he said casually, as if he hadn’t just obliterated David’s entire food supply. David snorted. “Yeah, I guess after all that, you’d be thirsty.” Eli twisted the faucet, cupping his hands beneath the flow of water. He drank directly from the stream, gulping long and deep. David watched quietly, feeling the faintest twinge of unease as Eli kept drinking… and drinking.

A few seconds passed, and then a notification popped up. Eli had sent three images. David hesitated briefly before clicking to open them. The first image showed a table overflowing with food—an elaborate Thanksgiving spread. There was a massive turkey, bowls of mashed potatoes, stuffing, pies, and countless side dishes. The sheer amount of food looked excessive, even <em>for </em>a large family gathering. The second photo was taken from the same angle but after the meal. Every dish on the table was empty, picked clean as if a small army had devoured the feast. Plates were stacked, and the remnants of the turkey were reduced to bones. David leaned in closer. It was hard to believe one person could eat that much. The third image, however, told a different story. The camera was zoomed in on Eli’s torso. His oversized hoodie was pulled up just enough to reveal his stomach—massive and round, stretched to the limit, filling most of the frame. The skin was taut, pale, and shiny under the room’s warm lighting. His hand rested on top of his belly, as if to emphasize its size. Eli: That was last Thanksgiving. David felt his breath hitch slightly. David: You ate all of that? Eli: Mhm. Everything on the table. David: No one helped you? Eli: Nope. Just me. David couldn’t help but imagine the scene—Eli, sitting alone at the table, methodically working his way through dish after dish, belly gradually swelling until it reached the size in the photo. David: I’ll admit, that’s impressive. Eli: Told you I’m not like the others. David’s lips curled into a smirk. David: Alright, you’ve got my attention. Eli: So, dinner at your place?

The room was bathed in the warm glow of overhead lights, casting gentle shadows on the table where David and Eli sat. Unlike the frenzy David had half-expected, Eli’s eating was almost… graceful. He worked through his plate with quiet precision, cutting each piece of chicken neatly, scooping mashed potatoes with measured swipes, chewing slowly but steadily. David leaned on his hand, elbow propped against the table, watching with growing curiosity. “You know,” David said, offering a slight smirk, “I thought you’d tear into this like a wild animal.” Eli glanced up briefly, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “I don’t need to rush.” His fork slid under another slice of chicken, which vanished moments later, swallowed with ease. David noticed the way Eli’s posture stayed relaxed, his shoulders loose as if he wasn’t aware—or didn’t care—how much he had already consumed. The portions David had initially thought were excessive were steadily shrinking. “You’re pacing yourself,” David remarked, refilling Eli’s plate without hesitation. Eli’s eyes flicked toward the second serving. “It’s easier that way. Just keep it coming.” David raised a brow but complied. Watching Eli eat was like witnessing some hypnotic performance—an endless rhythm of bite, swallow, and subtle request for more. Unlike the chaotic energy David imagined, this was something far more controlled. David wasn’t sure if it was impressive or unnerving. Plates emptied one after another. David caught glimpses of Eli’s stomach as his hoodie gradually lifted, exposing a thin strip of smooth skin that seemed to tighten ever so slightly with each passing plate. Yet Eli’s expression never shifted—he ate as if he were completely unaware of the gradual expansion pressing against the waistband of his sweatpants. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” David mused, setting down yet another plate. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, offering a brief shrug. “You cook well.” David chuckled softly. “Yeah, but I’m starting to wonder if you’d say that no matter what I made.” Eli smirked but said nothing, taking another bite. The kitchen grew quieter as the food disappeared, leaving behind only empty dishes and faint crumbs. Eli’s belly had become more noticeable by the time David set down the final serving—a loaf of bread and the last of the roasted vegetables. David watched carefully as Eli picked apart the bread, piece by piece, as though savoring the end of the meal. “I think that’s everything,” David said after a pause, glancing at the barren countertop. Eli sat back slightly, exhaling through his nose. His belly pressed against the table’s edge now, rounded subtly beneath the hoodie. David’s eyes lingered. “I’m not sure if I should be impressed or worried.” Eli chuckled softly, shifting in his seat. “I told you I could eat.” David nodded. “Yeah, but I thought you’d hit a limit at some point.” Eli tilted his head, his gaze locking with David’s. “Who said I have?” The words hung in the air for a moment longer than David expected, and something about the way Eli said it felt almost like an invitation.

David: Video. Eli: I thought you might say that. A file transfer notification appeared almost immediately. David hesitated for a second, then clicked to download it. The video opened in a dimly lit kitchen. Eli sat at a counter, alone, wearing one of his oversized hoodies that hung loosely over his frame. On the counter in front of him sat a burrito—enormous, easily the size of his forearm. David narrowed his eyes, expecting some kind of joke or trick. But Eli simply stretched his arms, rolled his shoulders, and leaned forward. Without hesitation, Eli opened his mouth—wide. Wider than David thought was physically possible. Slowly, he lifted the burrito with both hands and began sliding it into his mouth. The burrito disappeared inch by inch, Eli’s throat visibly bulging as it traveled down. David’s eyes widened in disbelief. Eli didn’t pause, didn’t gag, didn’t even seem strained. When the last of the burrito passed his lips, Eli casually closed his mouth and swallowed hard. His Adam’s apple bobbed once, and that was it. Eli looked directly at the camera, licking his lips. Eli (in the video): Still hungry. The video ended. David exhaled, shaking his head with a slight grin. David: Okay… that was insane. Eli: Told you I can eat. David: I guess dinner at my place isn’t such a bad idea.

The soft rush of water filled the kitchen, blending with the quiet hum of the refrigerator. At first, David thought nothing of it—everyone gets thirsty. But Eli didn’t stop. The water kept pouring, and Eli’s throat bobbed steadily with each swallow. His belly, already swollen from the feast, rounded further, pressing into the table with a low, ominous creak. “Eli?” David’s voice wavered slightly. Eli didn’t acknowledge him. His hands gripped the counter, leaning forward as he drank more, his body almost limp, like he was in a trance. David frowned. “Hey, man… you’re good, right?” But then he saw it—the gradual lift of Eli’s frame as his belly continued to expand, pushing him upwards. The legs of the chair groaned as his weight shifted, the bulk of his stomach swelling beneath the table. The first sharp crack echoed as the table legs bent outward, straining under the pressure. David took a step back. “Eli, that’s enough!” Still, Eli drank. His stomach surged forward, pushing the table further away with a dull screech as the legs gave way entirely. The table collapsed with a loud crash, sending silverware scattering across the floor. Eli’s belly surged into the space left behind, rolling over the broken wood like an unstoppable tide. David’s eyes widened. “Okay… seriously, stop!” Eli’s body lifted higher as his belly swelled, tilting his frame backward until his feet dangled inches off the ground. His hands clung to the edges of the counter, anchoring him in place as his midsection stretched forward, expanding into the empty air. The chairs splintered one by one, squeezed and flattened beneath the growing curve of his stomach. The countertop groaned as Eli’s belly began pressing into the cabinets, bending the wood with agonizing slowness. David retreated toward the living room, keeping his eyes locked on the expanding chaos. The kitchen filled with noises—deep creaks, snapping wood, and the unsettling sound of metal warping as the cabinets buckled. Plates shattered beneath the weight, and the refrigerator door let out a pathetic whimper as it caved inward, vanishing under the mass of Eli’s stomach. By the time David reached the couch, Eli’s belly pressed against the edges of the kitchen doorway, straining to break free. The pale skin stretched tightly, glistening under the lights as it filled every inch of available space. David’s heart pounded. Eli groaned faintly, shifting slightly as his stomach inched further into the living room. The surface of Eli’s belly trembled. “Eli… I really think you should—” A loud creak interrupted him as the upper cabinets snapped from the walls, vanishing beneath the ever-expanding dome of Eli’s body. David pressed his back against the couch, staring in disbelief. Eli’s belly now filled the entire kitchen, pressing against walls, the ceiling, and the doorframe. It stretched like an overinflated balloon, and David swore he saw the color begin to change—deepening to a faint pink, then to a worrying reddish hue. The sounds shifted, too. The soft creaks turned into groaning, high-pitched squeaks—like a balloon seconds before bursting. David clenched his fists. “Eli, I’m not cleaning this up if—” KRA-KRAAAKK! David winced as a large crack spiderwebbed across the far wall. The pressure was too much. Eli’s belly trembled, the taut skin vibrating as the creaks intensified, echoing like the last moments of a strained rubber band. “Eli?” Eli’s hands twitched at the counter, but he didn’t stop. The reddish tint deepened. David took another step back, reaching for the door handle. “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” KAAA-THOOOOM!!! The explosion rocked the apartment. A massive tidal wave of water erupted from Eli’s belly, sweeping across the kitchen and flooding the entire living room. David was knocked off his feet, coughing and sputtering as he surfaced, now chest-deep in water. Dishes, splintered wood, and half-dissolved plastic fruit floated by as David treaded water, blinking in stunned silence. When the flood finally began to settle, David pulled himself onto the couch, water dripping from his clothes as he surveyed the damage. The kitchen was submerged. Eli was gone. David exhaled, dragging his hands down his face. “…I have no idea how I’m going to explain this to the landlord.”","\n","^<strong>\"Congratulations!

The faint gurgling of water echoed through the quiet kitchen, but it wasn’t the sound that unsettled David—it was the sight before him. Eli’s stomach, already full and distended, swelled larger with each gulp. The round curve of his belly pressed harder against the counter, forcing Eli into an awkward lean as his midsection expanded outward, growing heavier with every passing second. The fabric of Eli’s hoodie stretched thin over the burgeoning mass, riding up further until the entire lower half of his belly was exposed. The pale skin glistened under the soft kitchen lights, pulled taut as his stomach bulged forward, rounding out like an inflating balloon. “Eli,” David said, his voice laced with caution. “You might want to slow down a bit.” Eli didn’t respond. David stepped forward, his gaze fixed on the way Eli’s belly pressed deeper into the cabinets, creaking as it squeezed into the shrinking space. The round dome of his stomach began to lift him slightly, shifting his weight onto his toes as his body was gradually pushed upward. “Eli, seriously,” David tried again, his nervous chuckle masking the growing concern. “You’re going to flood yourself.” Still, Eli drank. His belly let out a low, deep groan as it stretched further, inching closer to the kitchen floor, expanding outward in every direction. The table’s edge creaked as it bent slightly beneath the pressure of Eli’s ballooning stomach. David’s eyes widened. “Alright—enough!” He lunged forward, grabbing Eli by the shoulders and pulling him back with a grunt. Eli’s grip on the faucet tightened, but David tugged harder, dragging him away until his mouth slipped from the stream of water. Eli stumbled, his belly sloshing heavily beneath him, wobbling as he steadied himself against the counter. David took a step back, panting lightly. “What the hell was that?” Eli blinked, as if just realizing where he was. His eyes flicked down to his bloated stomach, his hands instinctively resting atop the heavy curve. “Sorry,” Eli mumbled, rubbing slow circles over his distended belly. “Sometimes I… zone out. It’s like a trance or something.” David’s brow furrowed. “A trance?” Eli nodded, his palm gliding over the crest of his stomach. “It happens when I eat or drink too much. I don’t really notice until someone snaps me out of it.” David’s gaze lingered on Eli’s belly, which visibly strained against his sweatpants, pressing far enough forward to rest on the tops of his thighs. “Yeah, well… you were about to turn into a water balloon.” Eli chuckled softly, shifting his weight as his belly let out a faint groan. “Wouldn’t be the first time.” David sighed, shaking his head with a bemused smirk. “You’re lucky I stopped you.” Eli yawned, giving his belly a final pat. “Guess I’ll crash here tonight. I don’t think I’m rolling out of here any time soon.” David chuckled as he wiped down the now-damp counter. “Yeah, I figured. I’ll set up the couch.” As Eli waddled slowly toward the living room, David leaned against the counter, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “I’ll order a grocery delivery for the morning,” David called out. “I have a feeling breakfast is going to be… intense.” Eli’s voice drifted from the couch, muffled but amused. “Good call.” David flicked off the kitchen lights, leaving only the faint glow of the living room lamp. “Night, Eli.” “Night, David.” David lingered for a moment, watching Eli’s massive belly rise and fall as he stretched out on the couch. Despite everything, he couldn’t help but feel curious about what breakfast might bring.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidsFingersTig.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The next morning",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidsFingersTig.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Breakfast"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidLeanedBackI":[["^David leaned back in his chair, setting his fork down with a soft clink. The last of his portion sat untouched on his plate. Across the table, Eli’s plate had been empty for several minutes, yet his eyes remained subtly fixed on the serving dishes still scattered across the table. “You know,” David said, wiping his hands on a napkin, “we could probably call it a night here.” Eli’s gaze drifted from the table to David, head tilting slightly. “I could eat more.” David’s lips twitched in amusement. “Of course you could.” He gestured toward the remaining food—half a loaf of bread, a bowl of roasted vegetables, and a few odds and ends David hadn’t managed to clear away yet. “Help yourself,” David said, already knowing the outcome. Eli offered a slight nod, calmly reaching for the bread. Bite by bite, it disappeared in steady intervals. The bowl of vegetables followed next, each forkful vanishing until nothing remained but faint traces of oil at the bottom. David observed quietly, fascinated by how casual Eli remained. His belly, already visibly distended, pressed firmly into the table, but Eli continued as if unaware—or unbothered—by the gradual tightness forming beneath his hoodie. Even as the final scraps disappeared, Eli’s calm demeanor never wavered. “Sure you’re not full yet?” David asked, raising an eyebrow. Eli patted his stomach lightly, the sound faintly muffled beneath the stretched fabric of his hoodie. “Not really.” David chuckled, shaking his head as he pushed back from the table. “Well, I’m out of food, so I guess you’ll have to make do.” Eli leaned back in his chair with a soft exhale, letting his hand rest atop his rounded belly. His hoodie had ridden up slightly, exposing just enough skin to reveal how tightly stretched his stomach had become. David couldn’t help but smirk. “You sure you’re going to be able to sleep like that?” Eli’s eyes half-lidded as he shifted. “I’ll manage.” David stood, collecting the empty plates. “I don’t know how you do it.” Eli shrugged. “Practice.” David placed the dishes in the sink, glancing over his shoulder as Eli shifted, trying to find a comfortable position with his growing belly pinned against the table. The weight of it forced him to sit at an angle, and David could tell even standing up would require some effort. “I’ll set up the couch,” David said, drying his hands. “No way you’re walking home tonight.” Eli smiled faintly. “Appreciate it.” David lingered by the doorway. “I’ll order groceries for the morning. Something tells me breakfast is going to be interesting.” Eli’s eyes sparkled in amusement. “Good idea.” David flicked off the kitchen lights as Eli waddled slowly toward the living room, his belly rounding out further with each careful step. “Night, Eli.” “Night, David.” As David settled into his own room, he glanced once more toward the couch where Eli sprawled out, hands resting comfortably on his full stomach. The apartment felt quieter, but David couldn’t shake the feeling that breakfast would bring an even bigger surprise.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidLeanedBackI.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The next morning",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidLeanedBackI.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Breakfast"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theLastPlateWasE":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The last plate was empty, save for a few breadcrumbs scattered across the surface. David sat back in his chair, watching as Eli leaned back, fingers tracing lazy circles over the taut curve of his belly. The hoodie Eli had worn earlier now bunched awkwardly just beneath his chest, leaving most of his stomach exposed. The soft kitchen light reflected off his smooth skin, stretched tight from the massive meal he had just consumed. David smirked, tilting his head. “You sure you’re done? You’ve eaten literally everything in my kitchen.” Eli’s eyes flicked toward him, the faintest smirk tugging at his lips. “I could probably fit a little more… if you had it.” David laughed, shaking his head as he stacked the empty plates. “I’m officially out. You wiped me clean.” Eli let out a satisfied sigh, stretching his arms above his head as his belly rose even further, shifting with the movement. His eyes drifted lazily toward David, watching him with an unreadable expression. “That’s fine,” Eli murmured. “I can wait for breakfast.” David paused in the middle of rinsing a plate, glancing over his shoulder. “Wait, you’re staying the night?” Eli’s gaze didn’t waver. “I don’t think I can walk home like this.” David chuckled softly, setting the plate down. “Fair enough. Couch is yours.” Eli shifted, pressing his hand gently against his swollen belly. “You’re not worried I might eat it too?” David raised an eyebrow. “As long as you don’t eat me, I think we’ll be fine.” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched into a teasing smile. His eyes trailed David slowly, lingering in a way that felt deliberate. “No promises.” David laughed, but the weight of Eli’s gaze hung in the air. There was something playful about it, but also something else—something that left David wondering just how serious he was. Eli’s voice lowered slightly, almost purring as he added, “I do still have room for something.” David met his gaze, and for a moment, the kitchen felt a little warmer, the air heavier.

The plates had long been cleared, and Eli now lounged on the couch, his swollen belly pressing heavily into his lap. David sat beside him, one leg casually tucked beneath the other, his gaze flicking briefly toward Eli’s exposed stomach as the fabric of his hoodie bunched beneath his chest. David’s eyes lingered, half-amused by how effortlessly Eli had devoured everything in the kitchen, but mostly intrigued by the way Eli sat, completely unbothered by the massive swell of his belly. “You’re going to sleep like a rock tonight,” David joked, nudging Eli lightly with his elbow. Eli smirked, tilting his head to the side as his hand lazily rubbed over the firm curve of his midsection. “Yeah, if I can get comfortable.” David chuckled, sinking deeper into the cushions. “You’ll manage.” Eli’s eyes drifted toward him, and for a moment, there was something unspoken in the air. His gaze softened, and David felt the faintest flutter in his chest. “Come here,” Eli said, voice low but inviting. He shifted slightly, patting the couch beside him. David hesitated briefly, but curiosity—and something else—drew him in. He scooted closer, his thigh brushing lightly against Eli’s. Eli’s arm rested lazily over David’s shoulder, pulling him in just enough for their sides to press together. The warmth of Eli’s body radiated through the thin layer of his hoodie, and David could feel the subtle rise and fall of his chest beneath his palm. “You’re not too uncomfortable?” David asked, his hand hovering cautiously near Eli’s belly. Eli let out a soft chuckle, pressing David’s hand gently onto the crest of his rounded stomach. “I’m fine. I kind of like it.” David’s fingers trailed absently over the stretched skin, tracing slow circles as Eli’s belly shifted faintly beneath his touch. “You’re weird,” David teased, though his voice betrayed the faintest trace of fondness. Eli grinned. “You’re the one rubbing my belly. What does that say about you?” David laughed softly, leaning his head back against Eli’s arm. “Fair point.” For a while, neither of them said much. David’s hand continued its slow, absentminded motions, while Eli’s fingers traced light patterns over David’s shoulder. It was comfortable. Easy. Eli’s voice broke the silence, his tone quieter, more deliberate. “You don’t have to stop, you know.” David felt his pulse quicken slightly at the suggestion, but he masked it with a soft chuckle. “I wasn’t planning to.” Eli shifted again, pulling David a little closer until his head rested against the soft expanse of Eli’s chest. David could hear the faint gurgle of digestion beneath his ear, a steady and oddly soothing rhythm. “You’re warm,” David muttered, his voice drowsy. Eli hummed in response, his fingers drifting lower to trace slow lines along David’s back. David let his eyes drift shut for a moment, but Eli’s hand dipped lower, fingertips grazing just beneath the hem of David’s shirt. The touch was light—teasing. David’s breath hitched slightly as he opened his eyes, meeting Eli’s gaze. Eli’s smirk returned, and his hand lingered at David’s waist, not moving but resting just enough to keep David aware of its presence. “You comfortable with this?” Eli asked, his voice low and smooth. David swallowed, feeling the warmth pooling low in his stomach. “Yeah.” Eli’s eyes darkened slightly, his thumb brushing small circles along David’s hip.

The soft glow of the kitchen lights cast gentle shadows across Eli’s swollen belly, rising and falling with each steady breath. Eli’s eyes lingered on David’s body, trailing down before locking onto his own. His tongue flicked out, wetting his lips, the playful smirk curling further as his hand traced along the curve of his distended stomach. “I’ve still got room,” Eli murmured, his voice dropping just enough to make David’s skin prickle. David exhaled shakily. His pulse thrummed in his ears, and the space between them felt suffocating. “You’re serious?” David asked, though the answer was already clear. Eli didn’t blink. “Why wouldn’t I be?” David’s hand hovered at his side, fingers twitching, uncertain whether to pull back or step forward. But something about the way Eli looked at him—like David was already halfway down his throat—made his heart race in ways he hadn’t expected. Eli shifted closer, the soft curve of his belly brushing against David’s thigh. David swallowed hard, his breath catching as Eli’s hand ghosted over his waist, resting just above his hip. “I could start small,” Eli teased, his thumb brushing against the hem of David’s pants. David let out a shaky breath, unable to suppress the heat that coiled low in his stomach. “Start wherever you want,” David murmured, barely recognizing his own voice. Eli’s smirk deepened, and without another word, he dropped gracefully to his knees. His hands slid down David’s legs, slow and deliberate, as his lips pressed softly against David’s ankle. David’s breath hitched. The warmth of Eli’s mouth made his skin tingle as his tongue traced along the curve of his calf, each motion sending electric sparks straight to his core. Eli’s lips stretched wider as he began to work his way up, the wet heat of his mouth swallowing David’s foot, his tongue curling around his ankle with teasing flicks. David’s chest rose and fell unevenly, his knuckles whitening against the counter. “Jesus,” David breathed, his head tipping back slightly. Eli didn’t stop. His mouth slid further, enveloping David’s shin with agonizing slowness. David’s breath grew heavier, his arousal evident through his tightening pants. Each shift of Eli’s lips sent shivers up his spine, and as Eli’s gaze flicked upward—meeting David’s eyes with quiet satisfaction—David couldn’t hold back the soft groan that escaped him. Eli’s eyes darkened with approval, his grip tightening on David’s thighs as his mouth worked higher. The fabric of David’s pants stretched taut over his growing arousal, and Eli’s lips paused just long enough to press against the bulge forming there. David bit his lip, his head swimming in the sensation. The soft drag of Eli’s tongue against the outline of his erection sent heat rushing through him. “Don’t stop,” David whispered, his voice strained. Eli’s response was wordless, his mouth continuing its journey upward, swallowing David’s knee and sliding further past his thighs. David’s breath caught as Eli’s lips pressed firmly over the growing tightness in his pants, the sensation tipping him over the edge. His body trembled as the release washed over him, his fingers tangling briefly in Eli’s hair as he gasped softly. Eli hummed in approval, pausing just long enough to give David’s sensitive length a teasing flick with his tongue, savoring the reaction. As David’s pulse slowed, Eli pressed forward, pulling David’s hips deeper into his mouth. The stretch was slow, deliberate, and overwhelmingly intimate. By the time Eli’s lips reached his stomach, David could feel the outline of his legs curled inside the warmth of Eli’s body. His skin prickled with the surreal sensation of being enveloped, inch by inch, his arousal returning with every teasing flick of Eli’s tongue along his abdomen. “You’re taking your time,” David managed, his head tilting back against the counter. Eli’s eyes sparkled mischievously as he swallowed further, his lips pressing over David’s chest, leaving soft kisses along his ribs. David’s breathing grew ragged as Eli’s mouth crept higher, his shoulders slowly slipping past Eli’s lips, the tight warmth surrounding him entirely. By the time Eli’s lips sealed over the curve of David’s chin, David felt weightless—half-dizzy from the rush of heat coursing through his veins. Eli gave one last slow, satisfied swallow, his belly rounding out even further as David curled into him fully. Eli stretched lazily, one hand resting against the massive curve of his stomach as he exhaled deeply. A faint groan of contentment escaped him as he sprawled back against the couch, his fingers tracing over the smooth, taut surface of his belly. “Perfect fit,” Eli murmured, gently patting the crest of his swollen midsection. David shifted faintly inside, his form outlined beneath Eli’s skin. Eli smirked, rubbing slow circles over his belly. “Don’t get too comfortable in there.” The soft creak of the couch filled the silent room, and Eli closed his eyes, letting his hands drift over the heavy dome of his stomach as he drifted off to sleep.","\n","^<strong>\"Well, that escalated quickly!

Eli’s fingers lazily traced circles along David’s back, drifting higher, then lower, just enough to keep David on edge without pushing the moment too far. David smirked, letting out a soft breath. “You’re doing that on purpose.” Eli’s hand stilled briefly before resuming its path. “Maybe.” David lifted his head slightly, eyes narrowing playfully. “You’re a menace, you know that?” Eli grinned, his belly shifting faintly beneath David’s palm. “I haven’t done anything… yet.” David rolled his eyes but felt the heat rise in his chest. He stretched his arms, his fingers brushing lightly over the taut curve of Eli’s stomach. “You’re definitely too comfortable with this.” Eli chuckled. “I think you are too.” David opened his mouth to respond but paused, his eyes flicking toward the balcony door. A thought crossed his mind, and a grin tugged at his lips. “Actually…” David sat up, reluctantly pulling away from Eli’s warmth. Eli raised a brow, lazily watching him. “Where are you going?” David slipped toward the glass balcony door, unlocking it with a soft click. “I forgot I have something out here.” Eli shifted to sit more upright, his stomach rounding forward heavily between his legs. “Oh?” David stepped onto the balcony, the cool night air brushing against his skin. In the corner sat a large pumpkin—leftover from when David had considered carving it for Halloween but never got around to it. He smirked, lifting the heavy gourd into his arms before carrying it inside. Eli’s eyes flickered with amusement as David placed the pumpkin on the table. “I figured since you’re still teasing me,” David said, tapping the top of the pumpkin, “you might as well put that appetite to work.” Eli’s eyes darkened slightly, his smirk widening. “You want me to eat that?” David shrugged. “Why not? You ate everything else.” Eli leaned forward, one hand resting on his belly as the other gently rolled the pumpkin closer. “Alright. Just for you.” David watched as Eli lifted the pumpkin, tilting his head back and opening his mouth. His jaw stretched wide—far wider than David expected—as the pumpkin slowly disappeared inch by inch. Eli’s throat bulged briefly, and with one final swallow, the entire pumpkin was gone. David exhaled a soft laugh. “That was ridiculous.” Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, leaning back with a satisfied hum. His belly, already round and taut, pressed further into his lap, subtly shifting with the added weight. “Anything else you want me to eat?” Eli teased, rubbing his stomach lazily. David chuckled, shaking his head. “Nah, I think that’ll hold you for the night.” Eli grinned, shifting deeper into the couch. “I wouldn’t count on it.” David flicked off the kitchen lights, stepping back into the living room to grab a spare blanket. “I’ll set up the couch for you,” he said, draping the blanket over the armrest. Eli yawned, his hand still resting protectively over the crest of his belly. “I’ll order groceries for breakfast,” David added. “Something tells me you’re not done eating yet.” Eli smirked, eyes half-lidded. “Good idea.” As David dimmed the lights, he watched Eli stretch out on the couch, hands sliding lazily over his stomach as his breathing slowed. “Night, Eli.” “Night, David.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidsHeadRested.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Next morning",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Intro.davidsHeadRested.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Breakfast"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theCouchDippedSl":[["^The couch dipped slightly as David shifted closer to Eli, his shoulder brushing against the soft curve of Eli’s belly.

His hand slid down to cover David’s, pressing it firmer against his stomach. “Not at all.” David’s eyes flickered up to meet Eli’s, his heart pounding in his chest. There was something intoxicating about the way Eli carried himself—effortless confidence wrapped in the warmth of playful hunger. Eli’s smirk deepened as he leaned in, his lips brushing lightly against David’s ear. “I think you’re holding onto something bigger than my belly right now.” David swallowed hard, his pulse quickening as Eli’s hand drifted lower, grazing over the growing bulge in David’s jeans. “You’re really not subtle,” David muttered, though his voice trembled faintly. Eli chuckled softly, his fingers working to undo David’s belt with practiced ease. “Why should I be?” David’s breath hitched as Eli’s lips trailed teasingly down his neck, inching lower until they hovered just above his waistband. With deliberate slowness, Eli slid David’s jeans down, freeing him completely.

Instead, he pressed further, swallowing David’s release with ease. Eli leaned back slowly, licking his lips with a satisfied hum. His hand drifted back to his belly, rubbing small circles as if to emphasize the fullness.

Beside him, Eli lay curled beneath the thin blanket, his head buried into the pillow, soft hair falling messily over his face. The blanket draped loosely over Eli’s frame, the gentle curve of his stomach now flat and soft, a stark contrast to the enormous swell it had been the night before. His t-shirt clung lightly to his body, rising slightly with each slow exhale. The room was peaceful, the stillness punctuated only by the occasional faint gurgle from Eli’s belly, empty once again after burning through the mountain of food he had consumed. David shifted slightly in his sleep, his arm brushing lightly against Eli’s waist. Eli stirred just enough to nuzzle deeper into the pillow, his stomach letting out a faint growl in protest of its emptiness. The sun crept higher, bathing the room in soft gold, as the morning stretched ahead of them.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli wakes to prepared breakfast",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli can't wait till the cooking si done",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.4.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-2","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli is woken by the doorbell",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.eliWokeToTheUnmi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.theKitchenHummed"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.0.c-2.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.4.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.theSoftChimeOfTh"},{"#f":5}]}],{"eliWokeToTheUnmi":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli woke to the unmistakable scent of sizzling bacon and melted butter wafting through the apartment. His stomach let out a low, impatient growl, and he stretched lazily in bed, running his hand over his flat stomach as if to soothe it. The smell was too tempting to ignore. Slipping out of bed, Eli padded toward the kitchen in just his loose t-shirt and boxers, yawning as he rubbed his eyes. As he entered, he spotted David at the stove, carefully flipping pancakes onto a growing stack. The table was already laid out—piles of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, sausages, golden toast, buttered croissants, and even a few breakfast sandwiches. David glanced over his shoulder, smirking. \"Morning. I see your stomach’s already up.\" Eli chuckled, patting his exposed belly as it let out another loud grumble. \"Yeah… I think I’m wasting away.\" He leaned against the counter, eyeing the feast hungrily. David grinned, his eyes lingering on Eli’s perfectly flat stomach. \"Hard to believe with that belly looking so empty. Sounds like it’s demanding a little attention.\" Eli stepped closer to the table, his eyes gleaming. \"It’s demanding a lot more than a little.\" Without waiting for an invitation, he grabbed an entire handful of bacon, stuffing several strips into his mouth at once. The crackling sound of the crispy bacon echoed as he chewed eagerly, barely swallowing before reaching for the croissants. He stacked two together, biting through both with a low moan. \"You could at least sit down,\" David teased, watching as Eli tore into a sandwich with one hand while shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth with the other. \"No time,\" Eli mumbled through a mouthful. \"I swear, I can feel myself shrinking.\" David laughed but couldn’t look away as Eli grabbed four pancakes at once, folding them over into a thick stack and stuffing them into his mouth. Syrup dripped down his chin as he chewed, his throat bobbing as he swallowed heavily. \"You’re going to choke if you keep eating like that,\" David said, setting down more sausages. Eli barely acknowledged him, now holding two breakfast sandwiches in one hand and biting through both simultaneously. He groaned in satisfaction as the food filled his stomach, his t-shirt beginning to ride up as his belly swelled from the sheer volume. David’s eyes followed the slow rise of Eli’s stomach, which now pressed gently against the waistband of his boxers. \"You know,\" David said as he brought another plate of pancakes over, \"if this isn’t enough, we could hit McDonald’s after. See if you can clear them out too.\" Eli grinned, his mouth full as he nodded eagerly. \"I like the sound of that,\" he said, barely pausing before reaching for the next plate. Halfway through the meal, Eli stood up and wandered to the fridge, his belly pushing slightly against his t-shirt as it hung heavier over his waistband. He yanked open the door, grabbed a gallon of orange juice, and twisted off the cap. Without bothering with a glass, he tilted the container back and began chugging. David’s eyes widened as Eli’s throat worked with each gulp, his Adam’s apple bobbing. The plastic container slowly crumpled as the liquid disappeared. In seconds, the entire gallon was empty, and Eli let out a satisfied sigh, licking a drop of juice from his lips as he tossed the bottle into the recycling bin. \"Thirsty?\" David asked, smirking. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Barely touched it.\" By the time David sat down with his own plate of eggs, Eli had already finished off half the table. Without hesitation, Eli reached across, grabbed David’s plate, and dumped the entire serving of scrambled eggs directly into his mouth. David blinked. \"I was going to eat that.\" Eli shrugged, licking a smear of butter from his lips. \"I needed it more.\" David grabbed another platter, setting down the remaining croissants and sausages. Eli’s eyes lit up instantly. He piled four croissants into his hand, squeezing them together and shoving them into his mouth until his cheeks bulged. Crumbs scattered across the table as he chewed loudly, his stomach visibly rounding out under his shirt. As Eli leaned back for a brief moment, his belly pushed higher against the hem of his shirt, lifting it just enough to expose the lower curve of his now-taut stomach. His belly continued to swell with each bite, but there was no sign of him slowing down or reaching his limit. David’s gaze flickered to the exposed skin, watching in fascination as Eli grabbed another sandwich, tossing it back like it was nothing. When there was almost nothing left, Eli grabbed the bowl of fruit from the center of the table and sat back, letting his full belly settle. David watched, pulse quickening as Eli lifted an apple to his lips. Instead of biting into it, Eli opened his mouth wide, slowly swallowing the apple whole. His throat bulged slightly as the fruit slipped down, disappearing behind his collarbone. David shifted in his seat, his pants suddenly feeling uncomfortably tight. Eli met David’s gaze with a sly grin. \"You like that?\" David didn’t answer, too focused on the way Eli grabbed a whole orange next, peeling it with his teeth before pushing it into his mouth in one go. Finally, Eli reached for a banana, tossing it into his mouth—peel and all—and swallowing with ease. David’s pulse throbbed visibly beneath his beltline, his arousal unmistakable. Eli leaned in closer, pressing his belly lightly against the table, letting the curve brush against David’s arm. \"So… McDonald’s for round two, or should we take care of something else first?\" David swallowed hard, barely able to contain himself.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Take care of something else",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Drive to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theSoftMorningLi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidJingledHisC"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theKitchenHummed":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The kitchen hummed softly with the comforting sizzle of bacon and the faint clink of a knife slicing through fresh bread. David moved with ease, layering cheese and ham onto the cutting board as the smell of buttered croissants filled the air. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the small mountain of breakfast ingredients he had lined up on the counter. Behind him, the soft padding of footsteps broke the quiet. David barely glanced back, catching sight of Eli shuffling into the kitchen, his loose t-shirt hanging lazily over his boxers. His hair was messy from sleep, and his eyes were still half-closed. Eli drifted to David’s side, his chin resting on David’s shoulder as he wrapped his arms around his waist from behind. His stomach, flat and soft, pressed lightly into David’s back. “Morning,” Eli mumbled against his neck, his lips grazing David’s skin. David smiled, flipping the bacon with practiced ease. “Morning. Figured I’d make us some sandwiches. Thought we could head to McDonald’s after if you’re still hungry.” Eli’s stomach growled loudly, rumbling between them. David chuckled. “Guess that’s a yes.” Eli’s hold tightened slightly, his fingers drifting over David’s hips. His breath was warm on David’s ear, sending faint shivers down his spine. “Smells good,” Eli murmured. “Patience,” David replied softly. “It’s almost ready.” Eli didn’t answer, but David could feel his gaze locked on the counter. His arms remained lazily wrapped around David, but there was a subtle tension in his body, like a cat watching prey. David felt Eli shift behind him, but before he could react, Eli’s hand slipped forward, snatching a slice of ham directly from the cutting board. “Hey,” David laughed, nudging him playfully with his elbow. “That’s for the sandwiches.” Eli smirked around the mouthful, chewing slowly as if to savor the bite. “Just a taste,” he mumbled, reaching for another. David arched an eyebrow but kept slicing. “One slice. Fine.” Eli pressed closer, his chin now resting on David’s shoulder as his eyes scanned the counter. His lips brushed lightly over David’s neck, soft kisses trailing lazily downward. David’s breath hitched slightly at the sensation, but he kept working, shaking his head with a small grin. Then, without warning, Eli reached across David’s chest, grabbing another handful of ham—three slices this time—and shoving them into his mouth. “Eli,” David warned, though his voice held more amusement than frustration. Eli grinned around the mouthful, his eyes glinting mischievously. “Can’t help it,” he mumbled between bites, already eyeing the loaf of bread. Before David could stop him, Eli grabbed the entire loaf, tearing chunks directly from it and cramming them into his mouth in thick, greedy bites. Crumbs scattered across the counter as he devoured it, his cheeks puffed slightly as he swallowed down the dense bread without hesitation. David set the knife down, watching in stunned fascination as Eli reached for the carton of eggs. “Don’t tell me you’re eating those raw,” David said, half-laughing. Eli gave him a smug glance, lifting the carton with one hand. “Watch me.” Without cracking them, Eli tilted his head back, opening his mouth wide. He dumped three whole eggs directly in, the shells crunching audibly as he chewed, swallowing them with ease. David blinked. “You could at least peel those.” Eli smirked, holding up the carton. “Nah. Extra crunch.” David reached to take the carton from him, but Eli spun out of his grip, popping another handful into his mouth. The last few eggs disappeared, shells and all, leaving only the empty carton in his hands. David could barely react before Eli crumpled the carton and shoved it between his teeth, chewing loudly on the cardboard. David’s eyes widened. “Wait—” Eli chewed through the carton as if it were nothing, swallowing the pieces with a satisfied sigh. His stomach let out a low gurgle, visibly rounding beneath his shirt. “You can’t be serious,” David muttered, watching as Eli grabbed the bananas next. Eli made deliberate eye contact as he peeled one halfway with his teeth, but instead of discarding the peel, he shoved the entire thing into his mouth, chewing slowly and deliberately. David’s hand trailed absentmindedly over Eli’s belly as it began to swell further beneath his shirt. The soft curve pressed into David’s palm, pushing outward with each bite Eli took. “You’re really putting on a show,” David said, his voice dipping lower. Eli smirked as he grabbed a bunch of bananas, unpeeled, and stuffed two into his mouth simultaneously. His throat bobbed as he swallowed them whole, the bulge briefly visible before settling heavily in his stomach. David’s eyes trailed over Eli’s swelling belly, his hand drifting lower as he traced the edge of his stomach, feeling how firm it had grown beneath his touch. Eli reached for the pan of bacon, grabbing several sizzling strips directly from the heat. “Eli!” David grabbed his wrist. “You’ll burn yourself.” Eli chuckled, popping the bacon into his mouth, grease glistening on his lips. “What, you think this is the first time?” David couldn’t help but laugh. His hand drifted further down, pressing against Eli’s belly, which had grown rounder with each passing second. Eli grabbed the paper grocery bags next, tearing into the croissants, muffins, and waffles packed inside. He dumped an entire box of cereal directly into his mouth, swallowing dry flakes in large handfuls before moving on to the milk, which he chugged straight from the gallon. By the time Eli reached for the remaining bags, David’s breath hitched. His belly had grown so large that it pressed firmly into David’s side, warm and solid beneath his hands. David pressed his lips to Eli’s neck, exhaling softly. “You ate everything.” Eli grinned, cramming the last of the paper bags into his mouth, swallowing them without hesitation. “I could still eat more.” David brushed his hand over Eli’s stomach, feeling the tightness beneath his fingers. “We could go to McDonald’s now,” he suggested, voice low. Eli leaned back against him, smirking. “Or we could stay in and… find something else to do.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theKitchenHummed.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Find \"something else\" to do",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theKitchenHummed.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theKitchenHummed.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theSoftMorningLi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theKitchenHummed.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidJingledHisC"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theSoftChimeOfTh":[["^The soft chime of the doorbell echoed through the apartment, barely loud enough to stir David from his deep sleep. Curled up under the covers, he remained completely still, his chest rising and falling with each peaceful breath. Eli, on the other hand, groaned softly as the sound tugged him from his slumber. He stretched, his t-shirt riding up slightly as his hand brushed over the flat surface of his stomach, which growled faintly in protest. Blinking lazily, Eli glanced over at David, who hadn’t moved an inch. The doorbell rang again. Rubbing his eyes, Eli slipped out of bed, padding barefoot to the front door in nothing but his t-shirt and boxers. His belly remained taut and flat, a sharp contrast to how round and heavy it often ended up after meals. Another faint growl rumbled from it as Eli absentmindedly gave it a pat, yawning as he reached for the door handle. When Eli opened the door, a delivery man stood outside, shifting slightly under the weight of several large paper bags filled with groceries. “Delivery for David,” the courier said with a polite smile, glancing down at the clipboard in his hand. His eyes flicked up briefly, clearly catching sight of Eli’s disheveled, half-dressed state. Eli grinned sleepily. \"Yeah, that’s for us. Thanks.\" The courier stepped forward, holding out the bags. There were more than Eli expected—at least five large ones packed to the brim.

The heat between them simmered, the smell of breakfast still lingering in the air. Eli leaned forward, palms flat against the cool surface of the counter, his back arching slightly as David pressed into him from behind. David’s lips brushed the nape of Eli’s neck, trailing lazy kisses down his shoulder while his fingers traced the soft curve of Eli’s belly, swollen from their earlier meal. “You just couldn’t wait, could you?” David murmured, his breath warm against Eli’s skin. Eli chuckled softly, tilting his head back to meet David’s gaze. “You made too much food. I was doing you a favor.” David smirked, tightening his grip on Eli’s waist as he pushed forward, grinding into him slowly. Eli’s knuckles whitened as he gripped the edge of the counter, his body pushing back to meet each deliberate thrust. The tension between them deepened, David’s hands roaming over Eli’s sides, sliding under his shirt to feel the warmth of his bare skin. Eli’s breath grew heavier, his stomach brushing against the counter, pressing further as David’s pace increased. Their bodies moved in sync, David’s lips grazing Eli’s ear. “I swear, you’re insatiable.” “You love it,” Eli teased breathlessly, arching into David’s touch. As David’s rhythm quickened, Eli’s gaze drifted toward the window. His eyes locked onto the small potted plant sitting innocently on the sill. A sudden, primal hunger flared in his stomach—a reflex he couldn’t ignore. His fingers stretched forward, curling around the ceramic pot as David’s grip tightened behind him. Without a second thought, Eli lifted the plant, tipping it toward his lips. David was too lost in the moment to notice at first. His breath grew ragged, his hips pressing harder against Eli’s. But as he opened his eyes, he caught the sight of Eli tilting his head back, the entire plant—pot, soil, and leaves—disappearing into his mouth. Eli’s throat bobbed as he swallowed smoothly, his stomach expanding slightly against David’s touch as the pot settled inside. David’s grip on Eli’s waist faltered for half a second, his eyes wide with disbelief. But the shock didn’t last long—if anything, it drove him further over the edge. “Jesus, Eli,” David groaned, his fingers digging into Eli’s hips as his body tensed. The sight of Eli swallowing the plant sent him spiraling into release, a deep, breathy moan escaping his lips as he buried himself in Eli. Eli smirked over his shoulder, licking a trace of dirt from his lips. “What? I was still hungry.” David slumped forward, his forehead pressing into Eli’s shoulder as he caught his breath, his hands slowly trailing over the swell of Eli’s stomach. His palms felt the faint outline of the ceramic pot beneath Eli’s skin, pressing gently as Eli leaned further into the counter. “You’re insane,” David whispered against Eli’s neck, still panting. “You’re the one who likes it,” Eli teased, his belly shifting beneath David’s touch. David laughed softly, wrapping his arms around Eli’s waist as he held him close. “You’re going to eat me out of house and home at this rate.” Eli grinned, straightening as he turned in David’s embrace, his stomach brushing against David’s. “That’s why we’re going to McDonald’s next.” David smirked, kissing him lightly. “Fine. But try not to eat the whole restaurant.” Eli shrugged. “No promises.” They lingered in the kitchen for another moment, David’s hands still tracing over Eli’s stomach before finally pulling away. “Come on,” David said, tugging Eli toward the door. “Let’s see if you can survive the car ride without swallowing something else.” Eli chuckled, rubbing his stomach. “I’ll try.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theSoftMorningLi.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^McDonald's visit",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.theSoftMorningLi.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidJingledHisC"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidJingledHisC":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David jingled his car keys as he held the door open for Eli. The sun was higher now, casting long shadows across the quiet street. Eli stepped outside, his swollen belly jutting out in front of him, stretching his t-shirt almost to its limit. His hand absentmindedly rubbed over the curve, feeling the weight of his earlier feast. “You sure you’re up for more?” David teased, watching as Eli carefully navigated down the steps, his belly bouncing slightly with each step. Eli smirked. “I told you—I’m never full.” David chuckled, unlocking the car with a soft beep. Eli waddled toward the passenger side but stopped, tilting his head as he eyed the car door. His belly pressed firmly against the frame as he tried to ease in sideways. “Uh… might be a tight fit,” Eli admitted, sucking in his stomach slightly to no avail. David bit his lip, holding back laughter. “Maybe you should’ve skipped that last loaf of bread.” Eli shot him a look. “Don’t pretend you didn’t enjoy watching me eat it.” David grinned. “Fair point. Let me help.” Eli stepped back as David lowered the seat as far as it would go, reclining it almost flat. Eli shuffled again, turning sideways and slowly sinking into the seat, his belly rising up between him and the dashboard. With a grunt, Eli shifted and adjusted, trying to pull the seatbelt over the mass of his stomach. The strap stretched but wouldn’t click. David leaned over, tugging at the belt with a laugh. “I think this thing’s at its limit.” “Fine,” Eli sighed, letting the seatbelt retract. “I’ll just hold on tight if you crash.” David gave Eli’s belly a light pat. “I’ll drive carefully. Wouldn’t want to pop you.” Eli smirked, letting his hands rest atop the dome of his stomach as David pulled out of the driveway. The drive to McDonald’s was quiet save for the soft gurgling coming from Eli’s belly. David kept sneaking glances at him, watching how the rise and fall of his breathing made his stomach press lightly against the dashboard. By the time they pulled into the parking lot, Eli stretched his arms above his head, groaning softly as his belly shifted. David parked near the entrance, cutting the engine as he glanced over. “Ready for round two?” Eli grinned, opening the door carefully and squeezing his way out. “Always.” David followed closely behind, his hand naturally drifting to rest against Eli’s lower back.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidJingledHisC.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^McDonald's visit",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidJingledHisC.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"McDonalds"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliAcceptedTheHe":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli accepted the heavy bags from the courier, his arms straining slightly as he brought them inside. The door clicked shut behind him, and he glanced toward the bedroom where David still lay, undisturbed and snoring softly. He set the bags down on the kitchen counter, rubbing his flat stomach as another low growl echoed through the quiet apartment. Pulling out item after item, Eli’s hunger only sharpened. Loaves of bread, cartons of eggs, packs of bacon, several blocks of cheese, pasta, a roasted chicken, pastries, two family-sized pizzas, two gallons of milk and orange juice, three fruit pies, two boxes of cereal, a large bottle of syrup, donuts, and a family pack of sausages—David had clearly stocked up for the week. Eli grinned to himself. “Or just for this morning,” he muttered, licking his lips. Without hesitation, Eli grabbed the roasted chicken straight from the bag. He didn’t bother with utensils or pulling it apart—his teeth sank into the bird, tearing off huge chunks, bones and all. With loud, satisfying cracks, the chicken disappeared, bones crunching effortlessly as he swallowed it down. Nothing remained but grease on his fingers, which he licked clean with a satisfied hum. Next, he pulled out the carton of eggs. Rather than cracking them, Eli tilted his head back and swallowed them whole, letting the smooth shells slide down his throat one by one. He grabbed the loaf of bread, ripping the entire thing in half and stuffing large chunks into his mouth, barely chewing before swallowing. His belly began to swell subtly, pushing against the fabric of his t-shirt, but Eli wasn’t slowing down. He popped open the syrup bottle and drank directly from it, thick sweetness coating his lips as he gulped greedily. The cereal followed, poured straight from the box into his mouth. When his throat dried, he grabbed the gallon of milk, tipping it back and drinking half the container in one go. Droplets ran down his chin and onto his shirt, but Eli didn’t care. He emptied the rest and tossed the carton aside, moving on to the juice. The gallon of orange juice disappeared just as quickly, his Adam’s apple bobbing with each deep gulp. His belly visibly stretched as the liquid settled, rounding out further beneath his shirt. Next came the fruit pies. Eli stacked all three, shoving a quarter of the stack into his mouth and biting straight through the boxes. He swallowed thickly, barely bothering to pull away the packaging before finishing off the rest, licking stray crumbs from his fingers. His stomach rounded out even more, lifting the hem of his t-shirt to reveal smooth, taut skin underneath. Eli patted the growing dome, which now pressed firmly into the waistband of his boxers. Piling sausages into one hand, Eli shoveled them down with little effort, finishing the entire family pack in seconds. His belly let out a deep, satisfied gurgle, but his hunger lingered. His eyes drifted to the remaining grocery bags. Crumpling one in his hands, Eli hesitated for a moment before biting into it. The paper crinkled as he chewed lazily, swallowing the bag like an afterthought. He grabbed another, stuffing it halfway into his mouth when David’s groggy voice drifted from the hallway. “Was that the delivery?” Eli turned, mid-bite, the edge of the paper bag still hanging from his mouth. His belly pushed forward prominently, fully exposed beneath the bunched-up fabric of his shirt. David stood frozen in the doorway, wearing loose pajama bottoms and nothing else. His eyes trailed down Eli’s swollen stomach, and as his gaze dropped lower, the unmistakable bulge in his pants betrayed his reaction. “You’re… eating the bags now?” David asked, stepping forward with a smirk. Eli swallowed the rest of the bag and shrugged. “Figured I’d clean up.” David’s eyes drifted back to the empty counter. “I see you left absolutely nothing for me.” He stepped closer, his hand resting on the firm curve of Eli’s belly, giving it a slow, deliberate rub. His fingers traced circles across the tight skin, feeling the faint gurgle beneath. Eli leaned into David’s touch, smirking down at him. “You were sleeping. I didn’t want it to go cold.” David chuckled softly, his hand lingering on Eli’s stomach. “Well, if you’re still hungry… we could hit McDonald’s.” His palm pressed more firmly against Eli’s belly, letting it push into him. “Or we could stay here and deal with… something else.” Eli’s eyes darkened slightly, his belly pressing harder into David’s hand. “I like the sound of both.” David’s arousal was undeniable now, his pajama bottoms doing little to hide it.

Someone must be planning a feast.” Eli smirked. “Yeah… something like that.” His stomach rumbled again, louder this time, and Eli’s eyes flicked down toward the remaining bags still in the courier’s hands. But something else caught his attention—the courier’s sturdy build, broad shoulders, and thick arms. Eli’s gaze lingered on him a little too long. The courier, sensing the stare, chuckled nervously. “Well, enjoy your meal.” But before he could turn away, Eli’s stomach let out a deep, impatient growl, louder than before. The sound seemed to echo in the hallway, and Eli tilted his head slightly, his grip tightening on the bags. “Actually…” Eli’s voice dropped, his smile shifting into something a little more predatory. “You might as well come in.” The courier hesitated for just a moment, caught off guard by the sudden shift in Eli’s tone. But Eli stepped aside, gesturing inside with a casual wave. “It’s a big delivery. Could use a hand unpacking,” Eli added, his eyes narrowing slightly. Reluctantly, the courier stepped inside, setting the remaining bags on the counter. “Alright, I guess I have a minute.” Eli closed the door softly behind him, locking it with a quiet click. As the courier began unpacking the bags, Eli set his own down, watching silently as the man pulled out groceries one by one. His stomach gurgled again, and this time the courier glanced over his shoulder. “Sounds like you’re hungry,” he said with a chuckle. Eli grinned, stepping closer. “You have no idea.” Before the courier could react, Eli’s hands were on him, pushing him gently but firmly against the counter. The man barely had time to gasp as Eli leaned in, his mouth opening wide—much wider than seemed possible. The courier’s eyes widened in shock as Eli’s lips stretched over his shoulders, and with surprising ease, Eli began to swallow him whole. The man squirmed slightly, but Eli’s grip held firm, his throat bulging as the courier’s upper body slid deeper inside. Bit by bit, Eli worked him down, his belly expanding with each gulp. The courier’s legs kicked faintly as they disappeared past Eli’s lips, his shoes falling to the floor with a soft thud. Eli’s throat finally settled, and with one last powerful swallow, the courier was gone. Eli leaned against the counter, panting softly as his belly stretched out in front of him, pressing tightly against his shirt and forcing it to ride up over the firm, swollen dome. But he wasn’t finished. Eli’s gaze drifted toward the bags of groceries sitting on the counter. Without even bothering to unpack them, he grabbed the first bag by the handles and lifted it to his mouth. Tilting his head back, he let the entire bag slide down, groceries and all. The plastic crinkled as it disappeared past his lips, leaving nothing but empty air in its place. One by one, the remaining bags followed. Bottles of milk, cartons of eggs, bread, fruit, packaged meat—everything slid effortlessly into Eli’s stomach, the plastic bags vanishing with soft gulps. His belly stretched even further, rounding out heavily beneath his tight shirt, which now barely covered the top half of his swollen stomach. David’s voice called from the hallway, still groggy from sleep. “Was that the delivery?” Eli turned, mid-swallow, as the last bag slipped past his lips. His belly gurgled loudly, rounding out to an almost exaggerated size, pressing firmly into the counter as he leaned back with a satisfied sigh. David appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes, but the moment his gaze locked onto Eli, he froze. His jaw dropped as he took in the sight of Eli’s massive, bloated belly and the empty kitchen, save for a single pair of shoes by the door. “What… the hell happened?” David’s voice cracked, eyes wide as he stared at Eli in disbelief. Eli smirked, patting the curve of his belly. “Took care of the delivery.” David stepped forward slowly, his eyes flicking between Eli’s stomach and the shoes near the door. “Wait… You ate the courier?” Eli’s grin widened. “Yeah. And the groceries. Didn’t even have to unpack them.” David’s gaze lingered on Eli’s belly, which shifted slightly as something inside moved. His eyes widened even further, his hand instinctively reaching out to press gently against the stretched skin. “Jesus, Eli… I can feel him moving in there,” David muttered, his voice laced with disbelief. His other hand drifted lower, brushing over the soft, warm curve of Eli’s swollen stomach. The movement beneath David’s palm was faint but unmistakable, causing David’s breath to hitch. Eli leaned into his touch, smirking knowingly. “Guess he’s getting comfortable.” David exhaled sharply, his fingers tracing slow circles over Eli’s belly. “I was planning to take you to McDonald’s for breakfast… but after this, I don’t know if you’ll even fit in the car.” Eli chuckled. “I could still eat.” David’s arousal was undeniable now, his pajama bottoms doing little to hide it. Eli’s gaze flicked down, taking note of the growing bulge with a knowing smile. “Well,” David said, pressing more firmly into Eli’s belly, “we could stay here and… see what else you can fit.” Eli’s eyes darkened slightly. “I like the sound of that.”","\n","ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"kurr","re":true},["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe1.0.9.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Stay in for \"MORE\"",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe1.0.10.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.9.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidsHandLinger"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe1.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.10.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.afterCatchingThe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidsHandLinger":[["^David’s hand lingered on Eli’s swollen belly, feeling the faint shifts and gentle gurgles beneath his palm. His other hand drifted lower, grazing along the tight waistband of Eli’s boxers, his arousal pressing firmly against the soft fabric of his pajama bottoms. Eli smirked, catching the hungry look in David’s eyes. “I guess you like me even more when I’m stuffed.” David swallowed, his fingers tracing slow circles over the firm curve of Eli’s belly. “I can’t help it… you’re impossible to resist like this.” Eli leaned closer, his swollen stomach brushing heavily against David’s hips, pressing into him like a soft, overfilled cushion. “Well, I’m not full yet,” Eli teased, his voice low and inviting. David shivered under Eli’s touch, but as he pressed closer, the sheer size of Eli’s rounded belly created an obstacle between them. David’s hips pressed against the curve, but it was impossible to get any closer without Eli’s stomach pushing him back. Eli laughed softly, realizing the situation. “I guess this thing’s in the way,” he said, giving his belly a playful pat. David grinned, brushing his lips over Eli’s neck. “I’m not complaining.” With a sly smile, Eli knelt down on the kitchen floor, adjusting his position as his belly pressed heavily against the ground. Slowly, he shifted his weight forward, letting his massive stomach spread out beneath him like an oversized cushion. As his belly expanded, Eli tipped forward even further, his legs lifting off the ground as he stretched out horizontally across the swell. It was like lying on a giant beanbag, his body balanced on top of his overfilled stomach, which now pressed firmly into the cool tile of the kitchen floor. His arms rested in front of him while his legs kicked faintly in the air, his belly beneath him holding him aloft. Eli glanced back at David, smirking. “Problem solved. Now come over here.” David knelt behind him, running his hands over the broad curve of Eli’s belly, feeling the warmth radiating from his skin. He pressed against it gently, marveling at how soft yet firm it felt beneath his palms. Eli’s belly gurgled faintly, shifting slightly under David’s touch. “Careful,” Eli teased, glancing back over his shoulder. “You might pop me.” David chuckled, leaning in to kiss the exposed stretch of skin just above Eli’s waistband. “I doubt that,” he murmured, his arousal pressing firmly against Eli’s belly as he moved closer. Eli shifted slightly, grinding back against David, but the weight of his own stomach made any movement slow and deliberate. David’s breath hitched as Eli’s hands slid down, tugging David’s pajama bottoms down and letting his arousal spring free. “You’re practically bursting,” Eli said with a grin, licking his lips. David barely had time to react before Eli leaned forward, taking him fully into his mouth with a slow, teasing motion. David groaned, his hands gripping Eli’s hips as he pressed deeper into the warm, wet heat of Eli’s mouth. Eli’s belly shifted beneath him as he bobbed his head, the soft creaks of the kitchen floor mixing with David’s breathy gasps. David could feel the weight of Eli’s belly pressing back into his thighs, creating an overwhelming sensation as Eli’s mouth worked him over with deliberate, hungry movements. David’s grip on Eli’s hips tightened, but Eli didn’t slow down. His lips glided effortlessly along David’s length, taking him deep with each motion, until David felt the pressure building rapidly inside him. Eli’s pace quickened, his throat flexing as David’s hips twitched beneath him. David gasped sharply, his climax hitting harder and faster than he expected. But Eli didn’t stop—his mouth stayed firmly around David as he swallowed everything David had to give. The intensity of the release caught David off guard, and his knees buckled slightly as wave after wave surged through him. Eli’s throat worked greedily, each gulp causing his belly to swell slightly larger, rounding out just a bit more beneath him. David’s climax lasted longer than either of them anticipated, and by the time Eli finally pulled back, his belly had expanded just enough to lift him even higher off the ground. David collapsed onto his knees, panting heavily, his hands resting on Eli’s bloated belly. His fingers traced soft circles over the stretched skin, feeling the faint warmth beneath them. Eli licked his lips, patting his belly with a satisfied sigh. “I wasn’t expecting that much,” he teased, shifting slightly on top of his stomach. “I think you pumped me up more than breakfast did.” David chuckled breathlessly, leaning down to kiss Eli’s lower back. “You’re too good at this,” he murmured. Eli grinned, resting his chin on his hands as he sprawled out on his belly. “I aim to please.” David slid his hand further down, squeezing the soft curve of Eli’s waist. “I was thinking about taking you to McDonald’s after breakfast,” he said with a smirk. “But now I’m not sure if you’ll even fit through the door.” Eli laughed, rocking back and forth slightly on his belly. “I’ll make it fit,” he replied playfully. “But if you’re up for another round, I wouldn’t mind staying right here a little longer.” David’s eyes darkened with interest, his hand trailing up Eli’s back. “Let’s take a minute to rest first. Then we’ll see if you can handle more.” Eli grinned. “I can always handle more.” They stayed there for a moment longer, David’s hands never leaving Eli’s belly, until eventually, they pulled themselves together and headed out for another meal.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidsHandLinger.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidsHandLinger.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.afterCatchingThe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"afterCatchingThe":[["^After catching their breath and sharing a few lingering touches, David and Eli finally pulled themselves together. Eli adjusted his t-shirt, though it did little to cover his still-swollen belly, which jutted out proudly beneath the stretched fabric. David tugged on a pair of sweatpants and grabbed his keys from the counter. “Alright,” David said, smirking as he ran his hand over Eli’s belly one last time, “I guess you can still fit a few McMuffins in there.” Eli patted his stomach, making it jiggle slightly. “There’s always room for more,” he replied with a grin. David chuckled and opened the front door, stepping out into the cool morning air. But as he took another step forward, he stopped abruptly, nearly bumping into Eli, who had followed closely behind. Parked directly in front of their building was the courier’s car. The engine was still off, and the driver’s seat sat empty. David blinked, rubbing the back of his neck. “Right… I forgot about that.” Eli’s belly gave a faint gurgle as he leaned against the doorframe, glancing lazily at the car. “I mean… he’s not gonna be using it anytime soon.” David shot Eli a look, raising an eyebrow. “You just swallowed the guy whole, and now you’re eyeing his car?” Eli smirked, rubbing his belly with one hand. “Well, I thought you wanted to go to McDonald’s.” David crossed his arms, staring at the vehicle thoughtfully. “Yeah, but leaving it here might draw attention… The neighbors might notice if the car just sits there.” Eli shrugged. “We could park it somewhere else. Or…” His eyes gleamed mischievously. “We could make it disappear too.” David sighed, glancing at Eli’s stomach, which shifted slightly beneath his t-shirt. “I swear, you’ll eat anything.” Eli patted his belly, licking his lips. “Only if I’m still hungry.” David chuckled but knew they had to figure out what to do.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.afterCatchingThe.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Drive the Car Somewhere Else",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.afterCatchingThe.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Feed the Car to Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.afterCatchingThe.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidSighedTwirl"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.afterCatchingThe.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidSighedTwirl1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidSighedTwirl":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David sighed, twirling the car keys in his hand as he glanced back at Eli’s swollen belly. “As much as I’m sure you could handle the car,” David smirked, “I think we should play it safe this time.” Eli chuckled, giving his heavy belly a firm pat. “Fine, fine. I guess I can let the car live… for now.” David slid into the courier’s car while Eli waddled toward the passenger side of David’s. David pulled the courier’s car around the block, parking it on a quiet side street out of view. He left the keys on the dashboard, casually locking the door behind him. As David approached his own car, he found Eli leaning heavily against the passenger door, arms folded over the top of his round belly. His shirt had ridden up even more, exposing a wide stretch of taut skin beneath the hem. Eli glanced at David with a smirk. “Uh… we might have a slight problem.” David raised an eyebrow, trying not to laugh as he took in the sight. “Can’t squeeze in?” Eli grinned, shifting slightly as his belly pressed against the door. “Not easily.” David walked around, opening the passenger door wide. Eli carefully angled himself, turning sideways to ease his belly into the seat. The steering wheel creaked softly as David watched Eli shift and adjust until he was finally wedged in, his belly partially resting against the dashboard. “There. Snug,” Eli teased, patting his stomach. David chuckled as he climbed into the driver’s seat. “Good thing we’re not driving far. Not sure how you’d get out if this was a long trip.” Eli smirked. “If I get stuck, you’ll just have to roll me out.” David pulled out of the quiet street, heading toward McDonald’s as the early morning sun crept higher in the sky. By the time they arrived, the parking lot was mostly empty, save for a few early risers grabbing breakfast. David parked near the entrance, cutting the engine as he turned to Eli. “You sure you want to go inside like this?” David teased, eyeing Eli’s protruding belly. Eli opened the door carefully, using both hands to guide his belly as he eased out of the car. “Of course. I need to stretch before round two.” David shook his head, unable to hide his grin as Eli straightened, his belly leading the way toward the entrance. As they approached the glass doors, David’s hand drifted instinctively to Eli’s lower back, his palm resting just above the swell of his belly. “Let’s see if McDonald’s is ready for you,” David murmured playfully. Eli chuckled, rubbing his stomach as they stepped inside. “I hope they stocked up.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidSighedTwirl.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidSighedTwirl.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"McDonalds"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidSighedTwirl1":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David sighed, twirling the car keys in his hand as he glanced back at Eli’s swollen belly. “As much as I’d love to park the car somewhere else,” David muttered, “I don’t know if I want to explain why the delivery guy’s car is randomly abandoned a few blocks away.” Eli leaned casually against the doorframe, rubbing slow circles over the heavy dome of his belly. “We could just make it disappear,” he said with a playful smirk, patting his stomach. David raised an eyebrow, eyeing him skeptically. “You’re kidding.” Eli’s stomach gave a deep, impatient gurgle. “I mean, I’m not full yet.” David’s eyes widened slightly as he watched Eli waddle over to the parked car. Eli circled it once, eyeing it as if sizing up the challenge. His hands rested on his hips, thumbs brushing the swell of his exposed belly as his t-shirt rode up even further. “Eli… it’s a car. Not a sandwich,” David said, following cautiously. Eli shot him a look, grinning. “You know better than anyone I don’t really have limits.” Before David could respond, Eli pressed his hands against the hood of the car, bending forward slightly. His stomach squished lightly against the metal as he opened his mouth unnaturally wide, his jaw stretching in that impossible way David was still getting used to. David’s heart raced as Eli’s lips wrapped around the front of the car. With a deep, slow inhale, Eli began to pull the vehicle forward, his mouth sliding further over the hood. Inch by inch, the car crept inside Eli’s expanding maw, his throat bulging as the front wheels lifted slightly off the ground. David watched in stunned silence as Eli steadily swallowed the car, tilting his head back to let it slide further down. His belly surged outward, pressing harder into the pavement as more of the car disappeared from sight. The soft crunch of metal echoed faintly as Eli’s stomach stretched larger, rounding out and pressing heavily against the ground beneath him. By the time the back wheels left the pavement, David could hardly believe his eyes. The entire vehicle slipped past Eli’s lips, and with a final gulp, it was gone. Eli leaned back with a deep exhale, his swollen belly now dominating his frame, pressed firmly against the ground like an overfilled balloon. David stared in disbelief, his mouth slightly open as he tried to form words. “You… you just ate a car.” Eli grinned, patting the massive curve of his stomach. “Told you I could handle it.” David approached slowly, pressing his hands against Eli’s belly. His fingers sunk into the soft, stretched skin, feeling the outline of the vehicle shifting faintly beneath the surface. “I can’t believe you actually did it.” Eli chuckled, letting out a soft belch. “Neither can the car.” David’s arousal was impossible to hide as he traced his hands along the curve of Eli’s overfilled belly. “Well… there goes our ride to McDonald’s.” Eli smirked but then leaned back slightly, a faint blush crossing his face. “I mean… I could activate my metabolism if you really want to go.” David raised an eyebrow. “Activate your what?” Eli rubbed his belly lazily. “I don’t do it often. Honestly, it’s exhausting. But I can burn through everything in here—” he gave his stomach a firm pat, “—in just a few seconds.” David blinked. “Wait… you can just digest all of this instantly?” Eli nodded. “Pretty much. But it’s like running a marathon. I end up starving right after.” David’s curiosity was piqued. “I need to see this.” Eli stretched, rolling his shoulders. “Alright, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” He closed his eyes, his breathing slowing as he concentrated. David stepped back slightly, watching as a faint warmth seemed to radiate from Eli’s body. His stomach began to shrink, the massive dome deflating rapidly, the outline of the car fading as his belly returned to its normal, flat state. The entire process took less than a minute, and by the end, Eli was panting softly, wiping sweat from his brow. David stepped closer, running his hands over Eli’s stomach, now perfectly flat as if nothing had happened. “That’s… insane,” David muttered, completely fascinated. Eli grinned weakly, leaning against David for support. “Told you. But now I’m starving.” David chuckled, wrapping an arm around Eli’s waist. “Alright. Let’s get you to McDonald’s before you decide to eat the building.” Eli smirked, resting his head briefly on David’s shoulder. “I make no promises.” They walked toward David’s car, Eli’s hand rubbing his now-empty belly as the faint warmth of the morning sun washed over them.","\n","ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"car_swallow","re":true},["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidSighedTwirl1.0.9.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidSighedTwirl1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.9.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theGlassDoorsSli"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theGlassDoorsSli":["ev",{"VAR?":"car_swallow"},"/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^The glass doors slid open with a soft whoosh as David and Eli stepped into the McDonald's.

Eli rubbed his belly lazily. “Told you, that metabolism trick burns through everything. Now I’m starving again.” David chuckled as they approached the counter. The cashier greeted them with a polite but routine smile until Eli stepped forward, squinting up at the menu with intense focus. The growl from his stomach echoed faintly in the quiet restaurant. “Alright,” Eli said, rubbing his hands together. “Let’s do… six Big Macs, four double quarter-pounders, five large fries, two twenty-piece McNuggets, three milkshakes, six apple pies, and… oh, you guys do breakfast all day now, right?” The cashier blinked, slowly lowering his hand from the register. “Uh… yeah, we do.” “Great,” Eli continued without hesitation. “Throw in eight sausage McMuffins and a pancake platter. Oh, and large sodas… make that two.” David raised an eyebrow, glancing sideways at Eli. “You sure you need all that?” Eli smirked, patting his flat stomach. “It’s empty.

And trust me, I’ll finish it.” David leaned in slightly, nudging Eli with his elbow. “You’re making them nervous.” Behind the counter, one of the kitchen staff peeked over, whispering to his coworker. “You think he’s serious?” Eli stretched, his shirt lifting slightly as he raised his arms. “Better start cooking. I’m not leaving until I’m stuffed.” The cashier finally punched in the order, swallowing nervously. “Alright, it’ll be ready in a few minutes.” David handed over his card, chuckling. “I think this is the part where we warn them you’re not joking.” The cashier glanced up again, still hesitant. “I’ll… let the kitchen know.” Eli sauntered over to a booth, sliding in without issue this time. David sat across from him, resting his chin in his hand as he watched Eli lounge comfortably, his arms crossed behind his head. “You’re lucky your metabolism works the way it does,” David mused. “Otherwise, you’d need two booths by the time we leave.” Eli grinned. “Give me twenty minutes.

David walked beside him, suppressing a grin as customers and staff alike shot furtive glances in Eli’s direction. The cashier at the front counter paused mid-sentence, his eyes slowly widening as Eli waddled forward, his belly lightly bumping against the counter with a soft thud. “Morning,” Eli greeted with a lazy grin, rubbing the crest of his belly. “I’ll take…” He squinted up at the menu, tilting his head thoughtfully. “Let’s start with five Big Macs, three double quarter-pounders, four large fries, thirty nuggets, two twenty-piece McNugget boxes, six apple pies, four milkshakes—vanilla and chocolate—and… a family-size chicken bucket. Oh, and twelve breakfast burritos if you still have those.” The cashier froze, blinking at Eli as if waiting for the punchline. David leaned against the counter casually. “You better start punching that in. And make it to-go. I think we’re eating in shifts.” The cashier’s hand trembled slightly as he began entering the order. “Uh… are you serious?” Eli smirked, patting the dome of his belly. “I wouldn’t joke about food.” One of the fry cooks in the back whispered something to his coworker, nudging him discreetly while pointing toward Eli’s massive midsection. David caught snippets of the conversation. “There’s no way… right? He’s gotta be ordering for ten people.” Eli stretched, his shirt rising further up his belly, revealing a broad expanse of taut skin. “Better make it quick. I don’t plan on leaving hungry.” The cashier glanced at David, visibly struggling to process the situation. “Uh… anything for you?” David chuckled. “Just a coffee. I’m good.” Eli leaned on the counter, his belly pressing even harder against the surface. “And if you’re worried about leftovers… trust me. There won’t be any.” The cashier swallowed nervously as he totaled the order. “T-That’ll be ready in about fifteen to twenty minutes…” David handed over his card. “No rush. He’s patient… usually.” As they moved to find a booth, Eli’s belly brushed against the tables. He tried to slide in, but the space between the seat and the table wasn’t quite large enough to accommodate him. With a grunt, Eli shifted, sitting sideways with his belly resting heavily on the bench beside him. David slid into the seat across from him, watching with thinly veiled amusement. “Might need to ask for a bigger table next time.” Eli grinned, drumming his fingers against his belly. “Or they just need to widen the booths.” David smirked, casting a glance toward the kitchen where whispers continued behind the counter. “You think they’re regretting taking that order?” David teased. Eli smirked, his eyes glinting with mischief. “Not yet.

Wrappers, cartons, and empty trays littered the table in front of him, a testament to the destruction his appetite had already caused. David swirled the last of his drink, grinning as he watched Eli pat his stomach contentedly. “You’ve eaten more than the entire breakfast rush,” David teased. Eli smirked, leaning forward slightly as his stomach let out a soft gurgle. “I’m just warming up,” he replied. His eyes flicked toward the counter, where the staff stood huddled, whispering nervously. Waving a hand toward the cashier, Eli called out, “Alright, here’s the deal—just start bringing me everything you’ve got. Everything on the menu. I’m not picky.” The cashier froze, glancing toward the manager, who stepped forward hesitantly. “Sir… everything?” Eli raised an eyebrow, his smirk widening. “You heard me. Burgers, nuggets, fries, desserts—if it’s on the menu, I want it. Keep it coming until there’s nothing left.” David chuckled, leaning back in his seat. “You really know how to make an impression.” The manager hesitated for a moment before nodding nervously. He barked orders to the kitchen staff, who scrambled into action, trays of food starting to appear at the counter within minutes. Eli’s grin widened as the first wave arrived—stacked burgers, large boxes of fries, and trays of golden nuggets. He wasted no time, grabbing two burgers at once and shoving them into his mouth. The wrappers crinkled in his hands as he swallowed thick gulps, barely pausing to breathe before moving to the next item. David watched, amused, as Eli devoured tray after tray with ease. Burgers vanished in seconds, fries disappeared by the handful, and nuggets were tossed back like candy. Eli’s appetite only seemed to grow, his stomach swelling further with each bite. “You’re like a black hole,” David teased, his hand brushing against Eli’s belly. Eli grinned between bites, his voice muffled by food. “You’ve only seen half of it.” The next wave arrived—breakfast items mixed with desserts. Pancakes dripping in syrup, cinnamon rolls, and pies piled high on a tray. Eli’s eyes lit up as he grabbed a stack of pancakes, folding them into a sandwich and shoving them into his mouth. Syrup dripped down his chin as he chewed, his throat bobbing with each massive swallow. Customers in the dining area stared in disbelief, some whispering, others pulling out their phones to record the spectacle. A few had already abandoned their meals, leaving half-eaten trays behind. As Eli moved on to the desserts, he reached for the pies, devouring them whole, crust and all. McFlurries were tilted back and gulped like drinks, the thick ice cream disappearing in seconds. A stack of cookies followed, crushed into a single ball before being stuffed into his mouth. His belly swelled larger, pressing into the table with enough force to make it creak. David shifted slightly, giving Eli more room as his stomach pushed outward, firm and round beneath his stretched shirt. “Still going?” David asked, his voice light with amusement. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, already grabbing the next tray. “They better not stop,” he said, his tone playful but firm. By the time the final trays were cleared, Eli leaned back with a heavy sigh, his hands resting on the enormous curve of his belly. The table in front of him was a wasteland of empty containers, and the staff behind the counter stood frozen, watching in stunned silence. Just as Eli was about to call for more, a nervous-looking waiter approached, clutching his notepad tightly. He swallowed hard, his voice trembling as he spoke. “Uh… s-sir… I’m afraid… we’re out of food. There’s nothing left.” Eli raised an eyebrow, his hand pausing on his stomach. “Nothing?” The waiter nodded quickly, sweat dripping down his temple. “You’ve eaten it all.” David chuckled, patting Eli’s belly. “Well, there you go. Mission accomplished.” Eli leaned back further, his grin returning as he rubbed slow circles over his taut stomach. “That’s disappointing,” he said lazily. “I was just getting started.” David smirked. “What now, champ?”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli demands stuff from storage",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli watches hungrily customer's food",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackInT2"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackInT3"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT1":[["^Eli leaned back in the booth, his stomach pressing firmly against the edge of the table. The pile of wrappers and trays in front of him barely scratched the surface of what he had already devoured. David sipped his drink casually, watching with amusement as Eli patted his slightly rounded stomach. The staff behind the counter exchanged nervous glances, unsure whether to approach the man who had already consumed more than the restaurant usually served in a day. “So,” Eli said, his voice carrying across the quiet dining area as he looked toward the cashier, “what else you got?” The cashier hesitated, glancing nervously at the manager, who took a shaky step forward. “Uh… we’re working on the next batch, sir,” the manager stammered. “It’s coming right out.” “Good,” Eli said with a grin. “Because I’m still hungry. Bring me everything. Every burger, every nugget, every pie, every last fry you’ve got.” He leaned forward slightly, causing his stomach to press harder against the table. “And don’t make me wait.” The manager nodded quickly, barking orders at the staff. They scrambled into action, trays of food beginning to appear at the counter within minutes. The first wave arrived—a mix of burgers and nuggets piled high on trays. Eli wasted no time, grabbing three burgers at once and shoving them into his mouth. Wrappers crinkled as he unwrapped more, devouring them with relentless speed. Nuggets were tossed back like popcorn, barely chewed before disappearing down his throat. David chuckled, leaning back as Eli reached for the next tray. “You’re really going all in, huh?” Eli grinned between bites, his voice muffled by a mouthful of fries. “You know me. No holding back.” The next wave arrived—family-sized fries, large sodas, and desserts. Eli grabbed handfuls of fries, stuffing them into his mouth as he tipped a soda back, draining it in one long gulp. Pies followed next, crushed into a single bite before vanishing. His stomach began to swell visibly, pressing further into the table with each tray. The bolts anchoring the table to the floor started to groan under the strain. The staff continued to bring out food as fast as they could prepare it, their faces growing more pale with each trip. Soon, the trays included breakfast items—pancakes dripping with syrup, stacks of cinnamon rolls, and platters of scrambled eggs. Eli devoured them all, syrup dripping down his chin as he licked his lips. By the time the final trays were cleared, Eli leaned back with a deep sigh. His belly was enormous, stretching far out in front of him, pressing heavily into the now-tilted table. The bolts gave one last groan before snapping with a loud crack. The table toppled forward, but Eli’s stomach rolled over it, crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, shaking his head as he rested his hand on Eli’s taut, swollen stomach. “You’ve officially eaten them out of business.” Eli smirked, patting his belly proudly. “Told you I could.” The manager and staff stood frozen near the counter, their faces pale as they whispered nervously among themselves. “He’s eaten everything,” one of them said, her voice trembling. “The kitchen, the storage… we’ve got nothing left.” The fry cook, still clutching a spatula, shook his head. “This is insane. He’s not human.” The manager rubbed his forehead, clearly unsure what to do. “We can’t just ignore him,” he muttered. “Someone has to go over there and tell him.” The cashier looked horrified. “Tell him what? That we’re out of food? What if he gets mad?” The fry cook snorted. “Yeah, and what if he decides to eat us next?” The manager straightened slightly, taking a deep breath. “Alright. I’ll go.” The fry cook grabbed his arm. “Wait. Are you sure? Maybe… maybe more of us should go. Safety in numbers.” The group hesitated, their eyes flicking nervously toward Eli, who leaned back in the booth, his eyes half-lidded as he rubbed his swollen belly contentedly. David leaned closer to Eli, smirking. “Looks like they’re debating who’s brave enough to come talk to you.” Eli chuckled, his hand resting lazily on the crest of his stomach. “They better hurry up. I could still eat more.” The muffled whispers behind the counter grew more frantic as the staff tried to decide whether to send the manager alone or approach Eli as a group.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT1.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Manager intervenes",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT1.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Group of employees intervene",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theHushedWhisper"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT1.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theStaffHuddledN"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT2":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back in the booth, his massive belly pressing heavily against the edge of the table, stretching his shirt to the point where it barely covered the top half of his rounded stomach. The manager and remaining staff huddled nervously near the counter, their faces pale as they watched Eli casually pat his gut. “So that’s it, huh?” Eli asked, his tone light but with a teasing edge. “You’ve really got nothing left?” The manager wiped sweat from his brow, stammering. “W-We’re completely out of prepared food, sir… but…” Eli arched an eyebrow, leaning forward slightly, causing his belly to shift and groan audibly against the edge of the table. “But what?” The manager hesitated, glancing toward the storage door. “There are still… some raw ingredients in the stockroom. Things we haven’t cooked yet. But they’re not ready for serving.” Eli smirked, rubbing his hands together. “Perfect. Bring it all out.” The staff exchanged nervous glances before hurrying to the back, pushing carts loaded with supplies. Soon, the first wave arrived—frozen burger patties stacked high, massive bags of fries, containers of cooking oil, and trays of uncooked nuggets. Eli’s grin widened as he grabbed the nearest box of frozen patties, tearing it open with ease. He didn’t bother unwrapping them, biting directly into the icy stack like a sandwich. The loud crunch echoed through the restaurant as David leaned back, watching with a mix of amusement and disbelief. “You really don’t care if it’s frozen, do you?” David teased, resting his hand on Eli’s belly. Eli shrugged, swallowing another mouthful. “Food’s food.” The next tray arrived—a stack of gallon jugs filled with cooking oil. Eli lifted one, twisting off the cap and tilting it back like a bottle of soda. The thick liquid sloshed down his throat, disappearing quickly as Eli set the empty jug aside and reached for another. David raised an eyebrow. “You’re drinking oil now?” Eli chuckled, gulping down another jug. “Adds flavor.” The staff continued unloading more supplies—bags of frozen fries, containers of sauce, and trays of uncooked nuggets. Eli tore through them all, the bags ripping open in his hands as he shoved handfuls of fries into his mouth. The frozen nuggets were tossed back like candy, and even the sauce packets weren’t spared, their contents squeezed directly onto his tongue. With every bite, Eli’s belly swelled larger, pressing harder into the table until it began to groan under the strain. David shifted in his seat as the table tilted slightly forward. “You’re about to break this thing,” David said, half-laughing, his hand tracing the curve of Eli’s stomach. Eli grinned. “Wouldn’t be the first time.” As the last of the raw ingredients disappeared, Eli leaned back with a satisfied sigh, his belly now rounding out so far that it completely filled the space between the booth and the table. But he wasn’t done yet. His eyes flicked toward the manager, who stood frozen by the counter. “Alright,” Eli said, his voice firm. “What else have you got?” The manager blinked. “W-What else?” Eli nodded toward the storage door. “Bring me everything. Boxes, wrappers, napkins, cups… if it’s in the stockroom, I want it.” The manager hesitated but quickly nodded, disappearing into the back. Soon, the staff returned with armfuls of cardboard boxes, stacks of burger wrappers, packets of napkins, and bundles of straws and cups. Eli grabbed the nearest stack of wrappers, crumpling them into a ball and shoving it into his mouth. The paper crunched loudly as he chewed, swallowing it down with ease. Napkins followed next, dozens at a time, disappearing in thick gulps. David watched in amazement as Eli worked through the next wave of supplies. Cardboard boxes were torn open, their contents devoured along with the packaging. Cups were stacked together and shoved into Eli’s mouth, disappearing in one long swallow. Straws and plastic lids vanished by the handful, adding to the growing bulk in his stomach. By the time the final tray of supplies was gone, Eli’s belly had grown so large that it completely overtook the booth. The table groaned louder, tilting dangerously forward before the bolts anchoring it to the floor gave way with a loud snap. The table crashed to the ground, but Eli’s stomach didn’t stop. It surged forward, rolling over the fallen table and crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, leaning back to avoid the expanding dome. “You just destroyed their furniture.” Eli smirked, patting his stomach proudly. “They shouldn’t make them so flimsy.” The staff stood frozen, staring at the destruction as Eli leaned back with a deep sigh, his hands resting on the taut, heaving surface of his belly. His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving the full expanse of his bloated stomach exposed. David reached out, running his hand over the warm, firm surface. “You’re insane,” he muttered, though his tone carried more admiration than criticism. Eli chuckled, tilting his head back against the booth. “Still hungry,” he teased. The manager approached cautiously, his voice trembling. “S-Sir… there’s nothing left. The stockroom… it’s empty.” Eli raised an eyebrow, his hand pausing mid-rub. “Nothing?” The manager nodded quickly. “Nothing. You’ve eaten it all.” Eli leaned back heavily into the booth, his enormous belly dominating the space around him. It pressed firmly against the crushed remains of the table and spilled out onto the floor, stretching taut and round like an overinflated balloon. His hands rubbed slow circles over the bulging surface, his face a picture of contentment.The staff huddled nervously by the counter, too afraid to move, while David sat beside Eli, smirking as he traced the curve of Eli’s stomach with his fingers.“Alright,” David said, leaning forward, “I think it’s time we get you home.”Eli chuckled, shifting slightly, but his belly barely budged. “Yeah, about that,” he said, his tone dry. “I’m not sure I can even stand up right now.”David raised an eyebrow, glancing down at the massive dome that had Eli completely pinned in place. His belly groaned audibly, pressing against the edges of the booth and leaving no room for movement.“Well,” David said with a grin, “this is a problem.”Eli sighed, rubbing his stomach. “You don’t say.”David stood, inspecting the situation as he walked around the booth. “You’re wedged in there pretty good,” he observed. “We’re definitely not getting you into the car like this.”Eli gave him a pointed look. “Thanks for the vote of confidence.”David laughed, tapping his chin thoughtfully. “Alright, we’ve got two options. You could activate your metabolism and burn through this… but I know how much you hate doing that.”Eli groaned, tilting his head back against the booth. “You know it drains me completely. What’s the second option?”David smirked. “I could call a friend with a crane.”Eli blinked, staring at him for a moment before bursting into laughter, his belly jiggling slightly from the motion. “You’re kidding.”David shrugged. “You’ve got a better idea?”Eli’s laughter faded as he considered the situation. He looked down at his massive belly, then back at David. “Fine,” he muttered. “Let’s figure it out…","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT2.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Activate the metabolism",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT2.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Call the friend",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT2.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLetOutADeepSi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackInT2.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackAga"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT3":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back in the booth, his massive belly pressing heavily against the table, which creaked under the strain. The staff stood clustered near the counter, casting nervous glances toward Eli as he casually patted the immense curve of his stomach. “So,” Eli said, his tone sharp yet playful as his eyes fixed on the wide-eyed manager, “you’re telling me there’s nothing left to eat?” The manager fidgeted nervously, his hands trembling. “W-We don’t have any more cooked food, sir. The kitchen is… empty.” Eli arched an eyebrow, his smirk growing wider. “What about the leftovers? The stuff you’re about to throw away? I don’t care what it is—bring it here.” The manager hesitated, looking to the remaining staff, who exchanged helpless looks. David, lounging casually beside Eli, chuckled softly. “You heard him,” David said, motioning toward the back. “Might as well bring it out before he decides to come back there himself.” The staff scurried to the kitchen, returning moments later with large black bags filled with discarded food. Eli grinned as they set the bags in front of him, his fingers already tearing into the first one. Inside was a mix of soggy fries, half-eaten burgers, and crushed drink cups. Eli didn’t hesitate. He grabbed handfuls of food, shoving them into his mouth with loud, wet bites. Wrappers crinkled as he chewed through them without pause, swallowing each mouthful in thick gulps. David raised an eyebrow, his hand resting lightly on Eli’s swelling stomach. “You’re really going for it, huh?” Eli grinned between bites, his voice muffled. “Nothing wrong with a little recycling.” By the time the first bag was empty, Eli was already reaching for the next. This time, he didn’t bother sorting through it—he simply grabbed the entire bag and tipped its contents into his mouth. Fries, nuggets, and even sauce packets tumbled in, vanishing rapidly. His belly groaned in response, pressing harder into the table as it expanded further. The second bag emptied, Eli leaned back with a sigh, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. But his hunger wasn’t sated. His eyes flicked toward the dining area, where a few brave customers remained seated, clutching their trays nervously. Scattered across the room were abandoned trays piled with leftover meals. Eli’s grin returned, more mischievous than ever. He sat up straighter, his belly shifting forward with a deep, audible groan as it brushed against the edge of the table. “Alright, listen up!” Eli’s voice boomed across the restaurant, causing every head to snap toward him. He gestured to the customers, pointing directly at his massive stomach. “If you don’t want to end up in here”—he slapped the crest of his belly for emphasis—“you’re going to grab every tray, every scrap of food, and bring it over to me. And don’t just set it down—dump it straight into my mouth.” The room fell silent for a moment. Then, one by one, the terrified customers scrambled to obey. They grabbed their trays and hurried toward Eli, trembling as they approached the booth. Eli leaned forward, his belly pressing even harder against the table as he opened his mouth wide—unnaturally wide. The customers hesitated only briefly before tipping their trays into his waiting jaws. Burgers, fries, drinks, and desserts slid directly into his mouth, disappearing in seconds as he swallowed effortlessly. “Faster!” Eli commanded, his voice booming as he pointed toward the remaining abandoned trays. The customers moved more quickly now, rushing to collect every last scrap of food in the dining area. One by one, they poured their trays into Eli’s open mouth, the sounds of gulping and chewing echoing throughout the restaurant. David leaned back, smirking as he watched the spectacle unfold. “You’ve got them well-trained,” he teased, his hand tracing lazy circles over the growing dome of Eli’s stomach. Eli chuckled, his throat bobbing with another massive gulp. “They’re learning fast.” By the time the final tray was emptied, Eli slumped back into the booth, letting out a long, satisfied sigh. His belly had grown so large that it completely overtook the space between the booth and the table. The bolts anchoring the table to the floor creaked loudly before finally snapping with a deafening crack. The table toppled forward, but Eli’s stomach surged over it, pinning it to the ground and crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, shaking his head. “You really know how to make an impression.” Eli smirked, patting the tight, round curve of his belly. His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his swollen stomach fully exposed.

The manager, sweating profusely, finally straightened and adjusted his tie. “Alright,” he muttered, “I’ll go. Someone has to tell him.” The fry cook grabbed his arm. “Are you sure? Maybe we should go together—” “No,” the manager interrupted, his voice trembling. “If we all go, it’ll look like we’re threatening him. I’ll handle this alone.” The cashier bit her lip, glancing nervously toward Eli, whose massive belly now sprawled across the remains of the table he had crushed earlier. He leaned lazily against the booth, patting the rounded dome of his stomach as it groaned faintly. David sat across from him, casually swirling his drink. “Looks like someone’s finally working up the courage to talk to you,” he said, smirking. Eli chuckled, wiping a crumb from his lip. “About time.” The manager approached cautiously, his hands shaking as he stepped closer. Eli’s gaze turned toward him, his sharp eyes glinting with amusement as he tilted his head slightly. “Uh… s-sir,” the manager stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. “I need to ask you to… to leave. You’ve eaten everything we have, and—” Eli’s smirk widened as he leaned forward, his belly pressing hard against the booth’s edge with a loud creak. “Leave? I’m not even full yet.” The manager flinched, his hands raised in a weak attempt at authority. “Please, sir, you’re causing… a disruption.” Eli’s grin turned predatory. “A disruption, huh?” He patted his stomach, the heavy thud echoing across the room. “How about I disrupt you?” Before the manager could react, Eli’s hands shot out, gripping his shoulders. His jaw stretched unnaturally wide, and with one swift motion, he engulfed the manager’s head and upper body. The room erupted in panicked gasps. The staff behind the counter froze in horror, watching as Eli tilted his head back, pulling the struggling manager deeper into his mouth. “Eli!” David called out, half-laughing. “Couldn’t even give the guy a warning?” Eli grunted, his throat bulging as the manager slid further down. His legs kicked briefly before vanishing completely with a loud gulp. Eli leaned back, patting his belly as it swelled slightly larger, groaning audibly as it adjusted to the new occupant. The cashier let out a scream, breaking the silence. “H-He ate him!” The fry cook dropped his spatula, his hands clenching into fists. “We have to do something!” Three employees rushed toward Eli, one grabbing his arm while the others pulled at his stomach, shouting frantically. “Spit him out!” one yelled, yanking at Eli’s wrist. Eli smirked, his body unmoving as if their efforts were nothing. “You really think that’s gonna work?” With a sudden, fluid motion, Eli lunged forward, grabbing two of the employees by their collars. The third stumbled backward, but not before Eli opened his mouth again, swallowing all three in rapid succession. Their muffled shouts faded as his throat bulged with their forms, and his stomach expanded further, pressing heavily into the booth and floor. David stood casually, watching the chaos unfold. With a swift motion, he grabbed a nearby table and dragged it in front of the door, blocking the exit. “Can’t have anyone running off now,” David said with a grin, dusting his hands. The remaining staff and a few terrified customers tried to scatter, but Eli was already moving. His belly sloshed audibly as he stood, his massive frame towering over the room. “Alright,” Eli said, his voice booming, “time to finish this.” One by one, Eli grabbed the remaining staff, swallowing them with ease. Their panicked screams were short-lived as they disappeared into his ever-growing belly, which groaned and stretched further with each gulp. The customers weren’t spared either. Those who hadn’t already fled found themselves cornered, their trays and meals abandoned as Eli approached. His jaws stretched wide, devouring them in groups until the restaurant was completely silent. David leaned against the counter, watching Eli slouch back into the booth, his belly now so massive it spilled across the floor, leaving him pinned in place. “Well,” David said, patting the crest of Eli’s stomach, “that’s one way to deal with customer service complaints.” Eli chuckled breathlessly, his hands rubbing slow circles over his swollen belly. “Can’t complain if they’re inside me.” David laughed, shaking his head. “Alright, big guy. Now how are we getting you home?” Eli groaned softly, shifting slightly, but his belly barely moved. “Yeah… that might be a problem.” David raised an eyebrow, gesturing to Eli’s enormous stomach. “You’re not exactly mobile right now.” Eli tilted his head back, sighing. “We’ve got two options. Either I burn through all this… or you figure out a way to haul me out of here.” David smirked, pulling out his phone. “Well, I know a guy with a crane.” Eli burst out laughing, his belly wobbling slightly from the motion. “You’re ridiculous.” David shrugged. “You’ve got a better idea?” Eli rolled his eyes, patting his stomach. “Fine.

David, sitting across from him, chuckled softly. “They’re taking their time,” he said, sipping his drink. Eli smirked, patting his belly. “They’re just stalling. They know I’m not done yet.” Behind the counter, the fry cook gestured wildly. “We can’t just let him sit there! He’s eaten everything!” The cashier shook her head, clutching her notepad. “But what do we do? We can’t stop him—did you see the size of him?” The manager rubbed his forehead. “If I go over there alone, he’ll just… do what he does. But maybe if we all go together…” The group hesitated, their eyes flicking toward Eli, whose belly groaned audibly, the sound carrying across the quiet restaurant. “Alright,” the manager finally said, his voice trembling. “We’ll go as a group. Maybe he’ll take us seriously if we all confront him.” The staff nodded reluctantly, forming a nervous line as they stepped out from behind the counter. Eli’s eyes flicked toward them, a mischievous grin spreading across his face as they approached. David set his drink down, raising an eyebrow. “Looks like they’re sending reinforcements.” Eli chuckled, sitting up slightly, causing his stomach to press harder into the booth. “How cute.” The group stopped a few feet from the booth, the manager clearing his throat. “S-Sir,” he stammered, his voice shaking, “we need to ask you to leave. You’ve… eaten everything, and—” “Not everything,” Eli interrupted, his voice smooth and teasing. “I could still eat more.” The fry cook stepped forward, his spatula clenched tightly in his hand. “Listen, you’ve gotta stop! There’s nothing left, alright?” Eli tilted his head, his grin widening. “Nothing left?” He glanced around the restaurant, his gaze settling on the group before him. “I wouldn’t say that.” The cashier gasped, stepping back. “Y-You can’t be serious…” Eli leaned forward, his stomach groaning loudly as it pressed into the booth. “Try me.” Before anyone could react, Eli’s hands shot out, grabbing the fry cook by his collar. The man yelped as Eli opened his mouth wide, engulfing his head and shoulders in one swift motion. “Stop him!” the manager shouted, lunging forward to grab the fry cook’s legs. The others followed suit, pulling at Eli’s arms and stomach, shouting frantically. But Eli didn’t slow down. With a powerful gulp, the fry cook disappeared entirely, his muffled shouts fading as Eli’s throat bulged briefly before his stomach swelled larger. The cashier screamed, backing away as Eli reached for the next employee. He grabbed two at once, his jaws stretching wide to accommodate both as they struggled helplessly. David stood, dragging another table to block the exit. “Can’t have anyone sneaking out,” he said with a smirk, dusting his hands off. The remaining staff tried to scatter, but Eli was faster. His massive frame moved with surprising speed, his arms scooping up the fleeing employees one by one. Their shouts echoed briefly before being silenced, swallowed whole as Eli’s belly expanded further, pressing heavily into the floor. By the time the last employee disappeared, the restaurant was silent. Eli leaned back in the booth, his enormous stomach now dominating the space around him. The remains of the table were crushed beneath his weight, and his shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his swollen belly fully exposed. David walked over, resting his hand on the tight curve of Eli’s stomach. “Well, that’s one way to deal with customer complaints,” he teased. Eli chuckled breathlessly, patting his belly. “They really should’ve brought more food.” David laughed, shaking his head. “Alright, big guy. Now what? You’re not exactly mobile right now.” Eli groaned softly, shifting slightly, but his belly barely budged. “Yeah… we might have a problem.” David raised an eyebrow. “You’re stuck, aren’t you?” Eli sighed, rubbing his stomach. “Looks like it.” David smirked, pulling out his phone. “Alright. We’ve got two options. You could activate your metabolism and burn through it all, or…” He paused, his grin widening. “I can call my buddy with a crane.” Eli burst out laughing, his belly wobbling slightly from the motion. “You’re ridiculous.” David shrugged. “You’ve got a better idea?” Eli tilted his head back, sighing. “Fine. Let’s figure it out. But make it quick—I’m already thinking about what’s for dinner.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.theStaffHuddledN.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli activates the metabolism",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.theStaffHuddledN.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^David calls the friend",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.theStaffHuddledN.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLetOutADeepSi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.theStaffHuddledN.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackAga"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLetOutADeepSi":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli let out a deep sigh, his hands resting on the taut curve of his belly. “I guess I don’t have a choice,” he muttered. “I’ll have to activate my metabolism.” David raised an eyebrow. “You sure? I know how much that takes out of you.” Eli groaned, rubbing his stomach. “It’s either that or call your crane buddy, and I’m not giving him another story to tell.” David chuckled. “Fair enough.” Eli closed his eyes, taking a deep breath as he concentrated. His breathing slowed, his hands pressing gently against the sides of his stomach. A faint warmth radiated from his skin, and David stepped back slightly, watching in fascination. Eli’s belly began to shrink. Slowly at first, then faster, the massive curve deflating like a balloon. The outline of his stomach softened, the tension in his skin fading as the bulging mass disappeared. Within moments, Eli’s body returned to its usual lean form, his t-shirt hanging loosely over his flat stomach. David raised an eyebrow. “That’s still insane to watch.” Eli slouched forward, bracing himself against the booth as sweat dripped from his forehead. “And exhausting,” he muttered. David stepped closer, grabbing Eli’s arm to help him up. “Come on, let’s get you home before you pass out.” Eli groaned, rubbing his stomach as they made their way to the car. “You better have snacks at your place.”The drive home was quiet at first. Eli leaned against the window, his stomach letting out occasional soft gurgles as his metabolism worked overtime. But after a few miles, Eli straightened abruptly, gripping his stomach as it let out a loud, angry growl. “David,” Eli said, his voice tense. David glanced over. “What’s up?” “I need food,” Eli muttered, his tone sharp. “Now.” David chuckled nervously. “We’re almost home. Just hang in there.” Eli shook his head, his eyes darting toward the roadside. “I can’t wait that long. Pull over. Anywhere. I need something—anything.” David sighed, glancing at the road ahead. “Alright, alright. Let’s see what’s around.” Up ahead, a small roadside stand came into view, its sign advertising ice cream and hot dogs. David smirked. “There’s an idea. Ice cream or hot dogs?” Eli’s stomach growled loudly, drowning out his response.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLetOutADeepSi.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Ice cream",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLetOutADeepSi.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Hot dogs",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLetOutADeepSi.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidPulledTheCa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLetOutADeepSi.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.hotDogsHeShouted"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackAga":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back against the booth, his massive belly pressing heavily against the floor. The once-bustling restaurant was now eerily silent, the air punctuated only by the occasional groan from his overstuffed stomach. David sighed, his arms crossed, staring at Eli with a mix of amusement and frustration.“Well,” David said finally, “there’s no way you’re walking out of here.”Eli smirked, patting the tight curve of his belly. “Guess that’s your problem, not mine.”David rolled his eyes and pulled out his phone. “Alright, fine. I’ll call someone who can actually move you.”Eli raised an eyebrow. “What, you’re calling a crane operator?”David smirked as he dialed. “Close enough.”About 30 minutes later, the sound of a roaring engine filled the parking lot. A custom-built truck rolled into view, its reinforced sides gleaming under the streetlights. The truck bed was equipped with a hydraulic lift and platform, clearly built for heavy loads.The driver, a burly man with a thick beard and an amused grin, climbed out of the cab. He took one look at Eli and let out a low whistle.“David,” he said, clapping him on the shoulder, “you weren’t kidding. That’s one hell of a belly.”Eli smirked from his position in the booth. “It’s all hard work, my friend.”The driver chuckled, walking closer to get a better look. “What the hell did you eat?”David shook his head. “Everything. Twice.”The driver laughed, shaking his head in disbelief. “Man, I’ve hauled some heavy stuff in my day, but this is definitely a first.”Getting Eli onto the truck was no easy feat. The hydraulic lift creaked under his weight as he waddled onto the platform, his enormous belly swaying heavily with each step. The driver worked the controls carefully, lifting Eli onto the reinforced truck bed as David secured him with thick industrial straps.“Think these will hold?” David asked, tightening the last strap.The driver grinned. “They’re rated for heavy machinery. If these can’t hold him, nothing will.”Eli leaned back, his hands resting on his stomach as the truck rumbled to life. “I feel like a king being carried to his throne.”David climbed into the passenger seat, shaking his head. “You’re more like a wrecking ball at this point.”Eli leaned back against the truck bed, his massive belly securely strapped down—or so it seemed. The truck rumbled along the winding mountain road, its engine groaning slightly under the weight. The moonlight cast long shadows across the landscape as the truck climbed steadily uphill.Inside the cab, David sat with the driver, glancing nervously at the rearview mirror. “You’re sure those straps will hold?”The driver grinned confidently. “Relax. This truck’s hauled construction equipment. He’s heavy, but he’s not that heavy.”In the back, Eli shifted uncomfortably as the truck took a sharp turn. His enormous belly swayed heavily to one side, pulling against the straps with a loud creak. His brow furrowed as he felt the tension increase.The straps groaned ominously with each movement, and Eli leaned forward slightly, shouting toward the cab. “Hey! I think these things are about to—”But the wind and the rumble of the truck drowned out his voice.As the truck climbed a steep incline, the sharp turn combined with the incline caused Eli’s massive belly to sway violently. The straps stretched dangerously, the metal buckles groaning louder with each passing second.“Guys! This isn’t going to—”SNAP!The straps gave way with a deafening crack, and Eli’s enormous form shifted suddenly. Gravity took over, and he rolled off the truck bed with a heavy thud.“David!” Eli shouted as he tumbled, his massive belly leading the way.David whipped his head around, his face going pale. “Oh no. Not again.”The sound of snapping branches and rustling bushes filled the air as Eli bounced and rolled down the hill like an enormous ball, his stomach wobbling violently with each impact.The driver hit the brakes, the truck screeching to a halt. “He’s rolling!”David groaned, unbuckling his seatbelt. “No kidding! Turn this thing around!”Eli’s chaotic descent ended with a loud splash as he landed in a small, tranquil pond at the base of the hill. Water erupted in waves, rippling violently outward as his massive form disappeared beneath the surface.David and the driver sprinted down the hill, panting as they reached the water’s edge. The pond was still now, the surface eerily calm, with no sign of Eli.David’s eyes darted across the water, his chest tightening. “You think he—”The driver hesitated, his hands on his hips. “That pond’s deep. If he can’t swim…”Before he could finish, the water’s surface began to ripple again. A faint, deep gulping sound echoed from below, followed by a powerful whirlpool forming at the center of the pond.David stepped back, his eyes widening. “Oh no… He’s not…”The driver’s jaw dropped as the vortex grew stronger, pulling leaves and debris into its swirling depths. The water level began to drop rapidly, exposing the muddy edges of the pond.From beneath the surface, a massive shape began to rise—a dome-like form pushing up through the remaining water. It glistened under the moonlight as the water receded further, revealing the unmistakable curve of Eli’s belly, which had grown even larger as he drank.David groaned, running a hand down his face. “I should’ve known.”The driver scratched his head, still staring in disbelief. “Is he… drinking the whole thing?”David sighed, crossing his arms. “Looks like it. Great. Just great.”Eli’s belly continued to rise, displacing what little water remained in the pond as the gulping sounds grew louder.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackAga.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli drinks most of the pond",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliLeanedBackAga.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theSoundOfDeepRe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidPulledTheCa":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David pulled the car into the small roadside lot, the flickering neon sign of the ice cream stand glowing in the fading evening light. Eli was practically vibrating with hunger, his eyes locked on the stand like a predator spotting prey. His stomach let out a loud, demanding growl, making David laugh. “Alright, alright,” David said, parking the car. “Let’s get you some dessert before you start eating the upholstery.” Eli didn’t wait for a reply. He swung the door open and marched toward the stand, his towering frame making the lone employee behind the counter straighten nervously. “H-Hi,” the employee stammered, his eyes darting up and down Eli. “What can I get you?” Eli slammed his hands on the counter, leaning forward. “Everything,” he growled, his voice low and commanding. The employee blinked, his lips twitching into a nervous smile. “Everything? Like… everything on the menu?” Eli’s eyes narrowed, and without a word, he reached across the counter, grabbing the front of the employee’s shirt and pulling him close. Their faces were inches apart as Eli’s grip tightened. “Everything,” Eli hissed. “Tubs, cones, toppings, shakes. All of it. And don’t waste time scooping, or you’re going in my stomach too.” The employee’s eyes widened in terror. “O-Okay! Right away!” Eli released him, and the young man stumbled backward, scrambling to the freezer. David leaned casually against the counter, shaking his head with a smirk. “You really know how to make an impression,” David said. Eli smirked, tapping his fingers on the counter impatiently. “Motivation works wonders.”The first cart arrived moments later, loaded with large tubs of ice cream. Eli didn’t wait for an invitation—he grabbed the nearest tub, ripped off the lid, and tipped it back, swallowing the contents in massive gulps. Thick chunks slid down his throat as his Adam’s apple bobbed with each swallow. David watched with amusement. “You know, most people eat ice cream for the flavor.” Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, already reaching for the next tub. “I’m not most people.” The tubs disappeared rapidly, one after another, as Eli devoured their contents without pause. His stomach groaned audibly, swelling larger with each bite. The fabric of his shirt stretched tighter, riding higher to reveal the taut curve beneath. Next came the cones, waffle bowls, and trays of fruit toppings. Eli grabbed a stack of waffle cones, crunching through them like crackers before shoveling handfuls of strawberries, bananas, and cherries into his mouth. The colorful sprinkles were dumped directly into his mouth from their containers, disappearing with thick gulps. “Faster,” Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The employee nodded frantically, returning with dispensers of syrups and bottles of whipped cream. Eli grabbed a syrup dispenser, tilting it back and gulping down the thick chocolate sauce like it was water. He emptied two bottles of whipped cream directly into his mouth, the sputtering canisters falling to the floor when they ran dry. David chuckled, crossing his arms as Eli worked. “You’re like a walking black hole.” Eli smirked between bites, his hands now working the milkshake dispensers. He tilted his head back, letting the thick shakes pour directly into his mouth. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry followed one after another, the cold liquid sloshing audibly as it filled his stomach. Finally, the employee gestured weakly to the soft-serve machines. “Th-That’s all that’s left,” he stammered. Eli’s grin widened. “Perfect.” Eli walked over to the machine and lay on his back beneath it. He reached up, pulling the lever and letting the creamy swirl of vanilla ice cream pour directly into his open mouth. David laughed, pulling out his phone to record. “You’re really committed, huh?” Eli didn’t respond, the stream of ice cream continuing uninterrupted as his stomach swelled further, pressing into the floor with a loud groan. He shifted slightly, pulling the lever on the second machine and letting the chocolate swirl flow into his mouth. By the time he stood, his stomach was massive, stretching taut and round. His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his belly fully exposed as it pressed into the counter with enough force to nudge it backward. The employee, pale and shaking, stepped forward cautiously. “Uh… w-who’s going to pay for all this?” Eli smirked, wiping a streak of chocolate syrup from his lips. “Consider it your lucky day,” he said, patting his swollen stomach. “I left you the stand.” David burst out laughing, grabbing Eli’s arm. “Alright, come on. Let’s get you out of here before he passes out.” As they walked back toward the car, Eli paused, his eyes narrowing. Across the lot, a small hot dog stand glowed under a flickering neon sign. David followed his gaze, raising an eyebrow. “Seriously?

Now!” David groaned, rolling his eyes. “Alright, alright! Keep your pants on.” He squinted into the distance, spotting the glowing sign of a small roadside hot dog stand. “There. That should shut you up for five minutes.” Before the car even came to a full stop, Eli was already out, slamming the door shut behind him and striding purposefully toward the stand. The vendor, a middle-aged man in a grease-stained apron, straightened up from his stool, startled by the sheer presence of Eli. “Evening!” the vendor called nervously. “What can I get for you?” Eli leaned on the counter, his hands gripping the edges as he loomed over the man. His eyes darted across the grill, the stacks of buns, and the trays of condiments. “Everything,” Eli growled. The vendor blinked, forcing a weak laugh. “Everything? You mean, like… one of everything?” Eli’s expression darkened, and without a word, he opened his mouth unnaturally wide, his jaw stretching to an impossible degree. The vendor gasped, stumbling back as Eli snapped it shut with a loud clack. “Everything,” Eli repeated, his tone ice-cold. “And don’t bother grilling or prepping anything. Just give me the boxes, bags, and containers. If you waste time, you’re going in next.” The vendor gulped, his face pale as he nodded frantically. “R-Right! Coming right up!”The first wave arrived quickly: boxes of uncooked hot dogs, plastic trays of buns, and gallon-sized tubs of condiments. Eli didn’t hesitate. He grabbed an entire box of hot dogs, tearing it open and pouring the contents into his mouth. The raw sausages tumbled down his throat in thick gulps, his Adam’s apple bobbing with each swallow. David leaned against the car, smirking. “You’ve really got a flair for terrifying small business owners.” Eli ignored him, already reaching for the next tray. He grabbed stacks of buns, shoving them into his mouth two or three at a time. Crumbs scattered across the counter as he chewed loudly, barely pausing to breathe. “Faster,” Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The vendor scrambled to keep up, dragging out trays of toppings—jars of relish, ketchup, mustard, and sauerkraut. Eli grabbed them all, twisting off lids and drinking the contents directly. The thick condiments dripped down his chin as he gulped, the empty containers clattering to the ground. His stomach began to swell, rounding out visibly beneath his shirt. The fabric stretched tighter with each bite, riding up to reveal the growing curve. The vendor’s hands trembled as he brought out the last of the supplies—bulk boxes of hot dogs and a plastic bin of raw onions. Eli tore into the boxes, dumping the sausages into his mouth like candy. The bin of onions followed, its contents disappearing rapidly as Eli chewed through them without hesitation. Finally, there was nothing left. Eli leaned back slightly, his hands resting on the massive dome of his stomach, which now pressed heavily against the counter. “T-That’s everything,” the vendor stammered, wiping sweat from his brow. “You’ve eaten it all.” Eli smirked, licking a streak of mustard from his lips. “Good,” he said, his voice calm but firm. The vendor hesitated, wringing his hands nervously. “Uh… who’s paying for all this?” Eli’s grin widened. Without a word, he turned toward the oversized plastic hot dog mounted above the stand. The vendor’s eyes widened in horror as Eli reached up, yanked the decoration free, and held it above his head. “What are you—” the vendor began, but his voice faltered as Eli opened his mouth wide. In one smooth motion, Eli shoved the enormous hot dog decoration into his mouth, his throat bulging as it slid down. He swallowed with a loud, exaggerated gulp, patting his stomach as it stretched even further. He leaned forward, his grin turning predatory. “Be glad I left you the stand,” Eli said, his voice low. David burst out laughing, walking over to grab Eli’s arm. “Alright, big guy. Let’s get out of here before you decide to eat the whole cart.” As they turned back toward the car, Eli paused. His eyes narrowed, locking onto the flickering neon sign of a nearby ice cream stand. David followed his gaze and groaned. “No. Absolutely not.

The once-deep pond had already been reduced by half, its muddy edges now exposed. “Is he seriously drinking the whole pond?” the driver muttered, his voice tinged with awe. David ran a hand through his hair, his jaw clenched. “Looks like it. I should’ve known.” Eli paused briefly, his head rising from the water. His mouth dripped with murky pond water as he let out a loud, satisfied BURP! The sound echoed like a cannon shot, sending ripples across the remaining water. David groaned. “Was that necessary?” Eli smirked, patting the crest of his belly, which groaned and sloshed audibly. “Completely.” His stomach let out a deep, ominous gurgle, the sound reverberating through the clearing. The massive dome of his belly, now glistening under the moonlight, pressed further into the muddy bank as it continued to expand. “Eli,” David called out, stepping closer. “You might want to stop now. You’re already enormous!” Eli ignored him, dunking his head back into the water. The gulping resumed, faster and louder this time, as his throat bobbed with each swallow. The driver scratched his beard nervously. “Uh… is it supposed to make noises like that?” David turned sharply. “What do you mean?” The driver pointed at Eli’s stomach, which was now groaning and creaking loudly, the skin stretched so tight it seemed to glisten. Strange glorps and squelches echoed from deep within, followed by faint vibrations that could be felt even at the water’s edge. David’s eyes widened as he took a step closer. “Eli, seriously! Stop before you—” Another loud BURRRPP! cut him off, this one deeper and more resonant than the last. Eli pulled his head from the water, his lips dripping as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “What?” Eli said, his tone lazy. “I’m fine.” “You don’t sound fine,” David shot back, pointing at Eli’s stomach. Eli tilted his head, his grin widening. “I’ve got this under control.” But his stomach let out another unsettling glorrrrrrrp, the vibrations causing small ripples to form in the remaining water.

The vendor’s laughter died instantly, replaced by a gasp as he stumbled backward.Eli snapped his mouth shut with a loud clack, his eyes narrowing. “Do I look like I’m joking?”The vendor gulped, nodding frantically. “R-Right! Coming right up!”The first wave arrived quickly: boxes of uncooked hot dogs, plastic trays of buns, and gallon-sized tubs of condiments. Eli didn’t hesitate. He grabbed an entire box of hot dogs, tearing it open and pouring the contents into his mouth. The raw sausages tumbled down his throat in thick gulps, his Adam’s apple bobbing with each swallow. David leaned against the car, smirking. “You’ve really got a flair for terrifying small business owners.” Eli ignored him, already reaching for the next tray. He grabbed stacks of buns, shoving them into his mouth two or three at a time. Crumbs scattered across the counter as he chewed loudly, barely pausing to breathe. “Faster,” Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The vendor scrambled to keep up, dragging out trays of toppings—jars of relish, ketchup, mustard, and sauerkraut. Eli grabbed them all, twisting off lids and drinking the contents directly. The thick condiments dripped down his chin as he gulped, the empty containers clattering to the ground. His stomach began to swell, rounding out visibly beneath his shirt. The fabric stretched tighter with each bite, riding up to reveal the growing curve. The vendor’s hands trembled as he brought out the last of the supplies—bulk boxes of hot dogs and a plastic bin of raw onions. Eli tore into the boxes, dumping the sausages into his mouth like candy. The bin of onions followed, its contents disappearing rapidly as Eli chewed through them without hesitation. Finally, there was nothing left. Eli leaned back heavily against the counter, letting out a deep, satisfied sigh. His belly had swollen even further, now enormous and pressing so far forward that it rested heavily on the ground. The faint creaks and groans of his overburdened stomach echoed softly, and his hands traced lazy circles over its taut surface.David stood a few feet away, arms crossed. “You’ve eaten two stands in one night. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look?”Eli grinned, licking the last traces of mustard from his lips. “Ridiculous? I call it impressive.”The vendor, pale and trembling, took a cautious step forward, his hands wringing nervously. “Uh… who’s paying for all this?”Eli’s eyes glinted with amusement as he looked up. Without a word, he reached for the oversized plastic hot dog mounted above the stand. The vendor’s mouth opened in protest, but no words came out as Eli yanked the decoration free and held it over his head.In one smooth motion, Eli opened his mouth wide and swallowed the massive decoration whole, his throat bulging briefly as it disappeared with a loud gulp.Eli leaned forward slightly, patting his massive stomach. “Be glad I left you the rest of the stand,” he said with a smirk.David groaned, grabbing Eli’s arm. “Alright, big guy. Let’s get you out of here before you eat the parking lot.”It took some effort, but David managed to steer Eli toward the car. Eli struggled to climb into the passenger seat, his belly too large to fit behind the dashboard.“This isn’t going to work,” David muttered, opening the back door.Eli grunted, squeezing himself into the back seat. His belly filled the entire space, pressing up against the windows and leaving David just enough room to close the door.“You’re ridiculous,” David said, climbing into the driver’s seat.Eli smirked, resting his hands on his stomach. “And you love it.”As they pulled into the driveway, David cut the engine and glanced at Eli. “Alright, champ. Home sweet home. No more stands, no more chaos.”Eli chuckled as he carefully maneuvered himself out of the car, his belly wobbling slightly with the motion. “For now,” he muttered, rubbing his stomach as he headed inside.David followed, shaking his head. “So, what’s the plan for tomorrow?”Eli glanced over his shoulder with a grin. “You’re the planner. What’ve you got?”David smirked, leaning against the doorframe. “How about something a little safer? An all-you-can-eat buffet?”Eli’s stomach let out an excited growl, louder than before. His grin widened as he patted it eagerly. “Now you’re talking.”David laughed, rubbing his temples. “I’m going to regret this.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliWaddledHeavil.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The Buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"McDonalds.eliWaddledHeavil.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Buffet"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliWaddledHeavil1":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli waddled heavily toward the ice cream stand, his belly already enormous from the feast at the hot dog stand. Each step caused his overstuffed stomach to sway slightly, the fabric of his shirt stretched so tight it had ridden up completely, leaving the taut, rounded surface fully exposed.David trailed behind him, running a hand through his hair in exasperation. “You’ve already cleaned out one stand. You seriously think you’ve got room for more?”Eli glanced back, smirking. “Room? I’ve got plenty. Don’t worry about it.”His stomach let out a loud, impatient growl, almost as if in agreement.The lone employee at the ice cream stand—a young woman with a bored expression—straightened up quickly as Eli approached. Her eyes widened as she took in the sheer size of him, and her grip tightened nervously on the scoop in her hand.“H-Hi,” she stammered. “What can I get you?”Eli leaned on the counter, his massive belly pressing into it with a low creak. “Everything,” he said firmly, his tone leaving no room for argument.The employee blinked, forcing a nervous smile. “Everything? Uh… like, one of everything?”Eli’s smirk faded slightly, his eyes narrowing. Without a word, he opened his mouth unnaturally wide, his jaw stretching to an impossible degree. The employee froze, her breath catching as Eli snapped his mouth shut with a loud clack.“Everything,” Eli repeated, his voice low and commanding. “O-Okay! Right away!” Eli released him, and the young man stumbled backward, scrambling to the freezer. David leaned casually against the counter, shaking his head with a smirk. “You really know how to make an impression,” David said. Eli smirked, tapping his fingers on the counter impatiently. “Motivation works wonders.”The first cart arrived moments later, loaded with large tubs of ice cream. Eli didn’t wait for an invitation—he grabbed the nearest tub, ripped off the lid, and tipped it back, swallowing the contents in massive gulps. Thick chunks slid down his throat as his Adam’s apple bobbed with each swallow. David watched with amusement. “You know, most people eat ice cream for the flavor.” Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, already reaching for the next tub. “I’m not most people.” The tubs disappeared rapidly, one after another, as Eli devoured their contents without pause. His stomach groaned audibly, swelling larger with each bite. The fabric of his shirt stretched tighter, riding higher to reveal the taut curve beneath. Next came the cones, waffle bowls, and trays of fruit toppings. Eli grabbed a stack of waffle cones, crunching through them like crackers before shoveling handfuls of strawberries, bananas, and cherries into his mouth. The colorful sprinkles were dumped directly into his mouth from their containers, disappearing with thick gulps. “Faster,” Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The employee nodded frantically, returning with dispensers of syrups and bottles of whipped cream. Eli grabbed a syrup dispenser, tilting it back and gulping down the thick chocolate sauce like it was water. He emptied two bottles of whipped cream directly into his mouth, the sputtering canisters falling to the floor when they ran dry. David chuckled, crossing his arms as Eli worked. “You’re like a walking black hole.” Eli smirked between bites, his hands now working the milkshake dispensers. He tilted his head back, letting the thick shakes pour directly into his mouth. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry followed one after another, the cold liquid sloshing audibly as it filled his stomach. Finally, the employee gestured weakly to the soft-serve machines. “Th-That’s all that’s left,” he stammered. Eli’s grin widened. “Perfect.” Eli walked over to the machine and lay on his back beneath it. He reached up, pulling the lever and letting the creamy swirl of vanilla ice cream pour directly into his open mouth. David laughed, pulling out his phone to record. “You’re really committed, huh?” Eli didn’t respond, the stream of ice cream continuing uninterrupted as his stomach swelled further, pressing into the floor with a loud groan. He shifted slightly, pulling the lever on the second machine and letting the chocolate swirl flow into his mouth. By the time he stood, his stomach was massive, stretching taut and round. His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his belly fully exposed as it pressed into the counter with enough force to nudge it backward. Eli leaned back against the counter of the ice cream stand, letting out a deep, satisfied sigh. His belly had grown even larger, now pressing heavily into the ground and leaving him practically immobile. The faint groans and creaks from his overburdened stomach echoed in the quiet of the lot.David stood a few feet away, arms crossed. “Two stands in one night. You’ve officially set a new record for ridiculousness.”Eli grinned, licking a streak of chocolate syrup from his lips. “Ridiculous? More like legendary.”The employee, pale and trembling, peeked out from behind the freezer. “Uh… who’s going to pay for all this?”Eli glanced up lazily, his grin widening. Without a word, he reached toward the oversized plastic ice cream cone mounted on the roof of the stand. The employee gasped, frozen in shock as Eli yanked it free.Without hesitation, Eli opened his mouth wide and shoved the decoration in, swallowing it whole with a loud gulp.Eli patted his massive stomach, smirking. “Be glad I left you the rest of the stand.”David groaned, grabbing Eli’s arm. “Alright, big guy. Let’s get you out of here before you decide to eat the parking lot too.”Eli struggled to move, his massive belly groaning audibly as he shifted. David sighed, shaking his head. “This is going to be fun.”It took some effort, but David managed to wedge Eli into the back of the car. His belly filled nearly the entire space, pressing against the windows and leaving David just enough room to close the door.As they drove off, David glanced over his shoulder with a smirk. “You happy now?”Eli chuckled, patting his belly. “For now.”When they finally arrived home, Eli groaned as he squeezed himself out of the car, his stomach wobbling with the motion.David followed him inside, shaking his head. “So, what’s the plan for tomorrow?”Eli glanced back, his grin widening. “You’re the planner.

His stomach let out a low, impatient growl, making his intentions abundantly clear. David stepped in front of him, crossing his arms firmly. “No. Absolutely not.” Eli raised an eyebrow, his grin widening. “Come on. Just one more. You know I’ve still got room.” David scoffed, gesturing toward the car parked nearby. “Room? Are you serious? If you eat anything else, you won’t fit in the car.” Eli smirked, patting the massive curve of his stomach. “We can make it work.” David rolled his eyes. “I’m not leaving you here while I call a moving truck. Get in the car, Eli. Now.” Eli chuckled, clearly enjoying David’s frustration. “You’re no fun.” David grabbed Eli’s arm, steering him firmly toward the car. “Fun is not explaining to someone why their stand is empty and my car’s suspension is wrecked.” Eli let himself be led, grinning as he wedged himself into the passenger seat. The dashboard creaked slightly as his stomach pressed into it, and he shifted with a soft groan. “You happy now?” Eli teased, resting his hands on the swell of his belly. David slid into the driver’s seat, glancing at him with a smirk. “Happier than I’ll be if you break my car.” The drive home was quieter, the only sounds coming from Eli’s occasional groans and the faint growls of his still-hungry stomach. As they pulled into the driveway, David cut the engine and turned to Eli. “Alright, big guy. Home sweet home. No more stands, no more chaos.” Eli chuckled, pushing open the car door. “For now,” he muttered, patting his belly as he carefully climbed out. David shook his head, following him inside. “You’re impossible.” Eli grinned over his shoulder, his tone playful. “And you wouldn’t have it any other way.” Once inside, Eli flopped onto the couch, letting out a satisfied sigh as his hands rested on his belly. “So,” he said, glancing up at David, “what’s the plan for tomorrow?” David raised an eyebrow, smirking. “I was thinking something a little safer for a change.

David stood at the edge, his arms crossed tightly, shouting in frustration. “Eli, I’m serious! Stop now! You’re gonna regret this!” The driver stood beside him, scratching his beard nervously. “Uh, he’s already bigger than my truck. What’s his endgame here?” David groaned, throwing up his hands. “There isn’t one! He just doesn’t know when to stop!” Eli lifted his head briefly, water dripping from his lips as he let out another thunderous BURRRPPP! The sound echoed through the clearing, making the driver take a cautious step back. “Relax,” Eli said smugly, patting the taut dome of his stomach, which groaned audibly. “I’ve got this.” David pointed at him, his face a mix of panic and anger. “No, you don’t! Look at you!” Eli ignored him, dunking his head back into the water. The remaining puddle disappeared rapidly as Eli’s body swelled even further, his skin stretching so tight it glistened under the moonlight. Suddenly, a sharp CREEEEAAAKKK echoed from Eli’s belly, followed by a deep, ominous WHUMP! His body jolted violently, and he froze mid-gulp, his hands instinctively gripping his sides. David’s eyes widened in alarm. “What was that?” The driver squinted, his tone cautious. “That… didn’t sound good.” Eli’s grin faltered for the first time. “Uh… I think—” Before he could finish, his stomach emitted an ear-splitting BLORRRPPP! that reverberated through the clearing. The tight dome of his belly quivered and contracted, and the air grew thick with tension. David took a step back, his voice shaking. “Eli, stop! You’re gonna—” BOOOOOOOOM! The explosion was deafening. Water, mud, and debris erupted into the air as a massive shockwave rolled through the clearing. David and the driver were thrown off their feet, landing hard on the muddy ground as the force rattled the nearby trees. When the chaos subsided, an eerie silence fell over the pond. The once-massive dome of Eli’s belly was gone. The pond was completely empty, its muddy bottom exposed, but there was no sign of Eli—no body, no sound, nothing. David pushed himself up on his elbows, his face pale and stunned. “Eli?” he called out, his voice trembling. “Eli!” The driver sat up slowly, wiping mud from his face. He glanced at the empty pond, then back at David. “Well,” he said, his tone light despite the situation, “at least he solved the water problem.” David turned to glare at him. “Not. Funny.” The driver shrugged, a faint grin tugging at the corner of his lips. “Hey, I’m just saying… he went out with a bang.” David groaned, burying his face in his hands as the driver stood, surveying the muddy, silent crater.","\n","^<strong>\"Eli: 0, Pond: 1, Structural Integrity: -100.

This doesn’t look good.” Eli lifted his head from the water, drops dripping from his lips as he let out a low, satisfied BURRRPPP! The sound reverberated through the clearing like thunder. “I’m fine,” Eli said smugly, patting his swollen belly. “I’ve got plenty of room.” David pointed at him, his tone sharp. “Your stomach says otherwise. Stop now before you regret it!” Eli rolled his eyes, but another loud, ominous GROOONNK from his stomach made him pause. His face twisted briefly in discomfort as the sound was followed by a deep, unsettling glorrrrrrp that vibrated through the muddy ground beneath him. The driver took a cautious step back. “Uh, I think you’re hitting critical mass, buddy.” Eli’s smirk faded slightly as he rubbed his hands over the taut surface of his belly. “Fine, fine. I’m done.” David let out a relieved sigh, stepping closer to the pond. “Finally. Now, let’s figure out how to get you out of there.” But as Eli shifted slightly, his stomach emitted another unsettling series of noises—a mix of deep gurgles, sharp creaks, and wet squelches. The vibrations were so intense that the remaining water rippled outward, and David stumbled slightly. “Uh… is that normal?” the driver asked, his voice cautious. David crouched closer to the edge, his hand shielding his eyes as he squinted at Eli. “Stay still. I need to figure out what’s going on in there.” Eli groaned, leaning back slightly as another loud glorp echoed from his belly. “Hurry up, genius. It’s not exactly comfortable.” David pressed his ear against the stretched surface of Eli’s belly, wincing at the chaotic symphony of noises inside. “Yikes,” David muttered, pulling back slightly. “It’s like a waterpark and a demolition derby in there.” The driver scratched his head. “So… what now?” David sighed, stepping back to assess the situation. “I’m not sure, but we need to figure this out before something worse happens.” Eli groaned again, patting his belly gently. “Just don’t take too long.

It’s exhausting.” The driver, standing beside David, raised an eyebrow. “Deflate? How’s he gonna pull that off?” David smirked slightly, glancing at the driver. “You’re about to find out.” Eli rolled his eyes, his hands pressing gently against his belly. “Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Closing his eyes, Eli took a deep breath, his body going still as he focused. A faint warmth began to radiate from him, the moonlight catching the thin sheen of sweat forming on his skin. His stomach let out a deep, resonant gurgle, followed by a series of rapid glorp-glorp-glorp sounds. The massive dome of his belly began to shrink, slowly at first, then faster as the water inside seemed to evaporate from within. Steam rose faintly from his body as the tight surface softened and collapsed inward, the once-massive curve flattening rapidly. David and the driver watched in stunned silence as Eli’s body returned to its normal lean form. Eli slouched forward, panting heavily as sweat dripped from his brow. “Every time,” Eli muttered, his voice weak. “It’s like running a marathon.” David approached, patting Eli on the back. “Yeah, but at least you’re not a giant water balloon anymore.” The driver shook his head, letting out a low whistle. “That was… something. You sure he’s human?” David smirked. “Debatable.”The ride back home was quiet, save for the occasional bump in the road and Eli’s tired groans from the back seat. David sat in the passenger seat, occasionally glancing back at Eli, who was sprawled out, eyes half-closed. “You good back there?” David asked. Eli waved a hand lazily. “I’ll live. Just… don’t ask me to move.” The driver chuckled, adjusting the rearview mirror. “He’s got guts—literally and figuratively. Don’t know how you deal with him, David.” David laughed softly. “You get used to it. Eventually.”When they arrived home, David helped Eli out of the truck, the smaller man leaning heavily on his shoulder as they made their way inside. Eli collapsed onto the couch, groaning as he stretched out. “Alright,” David said, leaning against the doorframe with a smirk. “What’s the plan for tomorrow?” Eli tilted his head lazily, a faint grin tugging at his lips. “I’m still recovering.

There’s no way we’re getting you home like this.” Eli grumbled, resting his hands on the crest of his enormous stomach. “I don’t want to,” he muttered. “I’m not giving up everything I’ve got in here. I worked hard for that McDonald’s haul.” David groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Seriously? You’re still thinking about the food? Eli, you’re the size of a house! Just let out the water you drank—it’s not like you’re digesting it anyway.” Eli glared at him, his lips pursing. “Fine. But only the water. The nuggets and burgers stay.” The driver, standing a few feet back, raised an eyebrow. “How is this my life right now?” David ignored him, waving a hand at Eli. “Good. Now, hurry up before you pop.” Eli sighed dramatically, leaning back slightly as his belly groaned beneath him. “You’re lucky I like you,” he muttered. He tilted his head back, opening his mouth wide. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a loud splorch, a high-pressure stream of water shot out, spraying across the clearing in an arc. The driver yelped, jumping to the side. “Holy—! It’s like a firehose!” David raised his arms to shield himself, shaking his head in exasperation. “I told you it would be like this!” Eli groaned as more water gushed out, his body visibly deflating. The taut dome of his stomach softened and shrank, settling back to its pre-pond-drinking size. He coughed slightly, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as the stream slowed to a trickle. “There,” Eli said hoarsely, patting his reduced belly. “Happy now?” David crossed his arms, inspecting him. “Better. You’re still huge, but at least you’re not a walking reservoir anymore.” The driver shook his head, chuckling. “I’ll get the straps ready—this time, extra straps.”With great effort and multiple industrial straps, Eli was hoisted back onto the hydraulic platform and secured to the truck bed. The driver added several additional straps for good measure, double-checking each one. “This should hold,” the driver muttered, tightening the last strap. “If it doesn’t, I’m retiring.” David smirked, giving the straps a final tug. “He’s not going anywhere this time.” Eli grinned lazily, resting his hands on his stomach. “I wasn’t planning to.”The drive back home was uneventful, though the occasional slosh from Eli’s stomach filled the silence. David sat in the cab, glancing back through the window periodically. “You good back there?” David called. Eli waved lazily, his voice tired. “I’m fine. Just… let me nap.” The driver chuckled. “You’re a piece of work, big guy. I’ve never hauled anything like you before.” David smirked. “You should see him on a good day.”When they arrived home, it became clear that Eli wasn’t fitting through the front door. Even with his reduced size, he stretched too wide to fit through the frame. Eli sighed, glancing at the house. “Guess I’m sleeping outside.” David groaned, pointing toward the backyard. “Fine. But stay away from the shed.” Eli chuckled as he waddled toward the yard, lowering himself onto the grass with a contented sigh. His belly let out a faint gurgle as he settled in.

Next to him, Eli was practically buzzing with excitement, his hands fidgeting on his lap. His shirt sat flat against his stomach, a rare sight that David couldn’t help but notice with a faint smile. “All-you-can-eat buffet,” Eli said, almost reverently. “It’s been too long.” David nodded, keeping his eyes on the road but secretly thrilled at what might unfold. He wasn’t about to admit it, but there was something mesmerizing about watching Eli’s seemingly endless appetite take over. Deep down, he wondered just how far Eli could go this time. The parking lot of the buffet was nearly full, the neon sign above the entrance flashing a welcome. As they stepped inside, the aromas hit them like a tidal wave: roasted meats, buttery bread, and sweet desserts all mingling in the air. Eli inhaled deeply, closing his eyes for a moment like he was savoring the smell before the feast even began. “Good morning!” a cheerful waiter greeted them. “Table for two?” “Yes, please,” David replied, his tone calm as always. Eli, meanwhile, barely glanced at the waiter, his attention locked onto the long buffet tables overflowing with food. They were seated in a booth near the middle of the dining room, offering a perfect view of the buffet. The moment they sat down, Eli leaned forward. “I’ll go take a look,” he said quickly, already sliding out of the booth. David chuckled softly as he watched Eli head straight for the buffet. The man started slow, loading his first plate with roasted chicken, a scoop of mashed potatoes, and a small portion of green beans. It was almost modest. Eli returned to the table, sat down, and ate methodically, savoring each bite. He didn’t say much, and David didn’t interrupt, sipping his coffee and waiting. But it wasn’t long before Eli’s pace quickened. He wiped his mouth, stood up, and this time grabbed a tray. David leaned back in the booth, his lips curling into a slight smile as Eli began stacking plates onto the tray. First one, then another, then a third. Each plate was piled high: sizzling ribs, creamy pasta, fried shrimp, and golden fries. He even threw in a plate of desserts for good measure. By the time Eli returned to the table, the tray was nearly bending under the weight. He slid into the booth with a look of pure determination, as if this was a challenge he’d been training for. David folded his arms and watched, his amusement growing as Eli attacked the food with increasing enthusiasm. Plate after plate disappeared. Eli’s pace grew relentless, and though his eating wasn’t particularly messy, the sheer volume of food was enough to draw attention from a few nearby diners. The buffet staff, however, remained blissfully unaware of the storm brewing at Eli’s booth. Finally, as the last bite of dessert vanished, Eli let out a contented sigh. He leaned back in the booth, his stomach visibly swollen beneath his shirt. With a satisfied grin, he pulled up the hem of his shirt, revealing his now-rounded belly. He gave it a couple of hearty pats, the sound of his hand meeting his stretched skin echoing faintly across the booth. “Now that,” Eli said, “is what I call breakfast.” David couldn’t hide his grin as he reached for his coffee. The calm moment lingered for just a second longer before the possibilities ahead began to take shape.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli goes wild (non-vore)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli goes wild (vore)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Buffet_non_vore"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Buffet_vore"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Buffet_non_vore":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^After patting his swollen belly with satisfaction, he leaned forward and pushed himself up from the booth. David casually sipped his coffee, watching with quiet amusement as Eli made his way back to the buffet. This time, Eli wasn’t holding back. He grabbed a tray and began stacking it with plates, one after another. Roasted ribs, fried chicken, piles of pasta, crispy fries, buttered rolls—every dish he passed found its way onto a plate. Soon, the tray groaned under the weight of five, six, seven overflowing plates, sauces dripping down the sides, meats stacked so high they threatened to topple over. Eli wobbled slightly under the load but grinned triumphantly as he shuffled back to their booth. David barely glanced up. He casually picked at a small plate of fruit, plucking a single grape and popping it into his mouth. “Pacing yourself, I see,” he remarked dryly. Eli didn’t answer. He slammed the tray down, grabbed a spoon in one hand and a chunk of bread in the other, and dove in. His eating was relentless. He scooped up pasta by the fistful, shoveled mashed potatoes into his mouth with the spoon, and tore into roasted meat with his bare hands. Gravy and sauce smeared the corners of his mouth, but Eli didn’t care. His eyes were laser-focused on the food. David leaned back comfortably, observing the spectacle. His smirk widened as he noticed nearby diners starting to stare. Murmurs rippled through the dining hall. A family at a nearby table exchanged uneasy glances. A man paused mid-bite, blinking in disbelief. At the buffet counter, two employees watched Eli with growing concern. “Is he… is he allowed to take that much?” one whispered. “It’s all-you-can-eat,” the other muttered, though uncertainty tinged his voice. “But… I mean, all?” Back at the booth, Eli finished another plate and shoved it aside with a loud clang. He barely paused to breathe before moving on to the next, his swollen stomach now pressing tightly against his shirt. The fabric strained, the buttons holding on for dear life. David casually leaned forward. “You’re drawing a bit of a crowd.” Eli didn’t look up. “They should’ve come earlier if they wanted some,” he mumbled through a mouthful of fries. Another trip to the buffet. This time, Eli grabbed two trays, stacking plates so high they nearly blocked his vision. Grilled sausages, skewered meats, cheesy casseroles, more fried chicken, entire cakes sliced into quarters—all heaped in a chaotic mountain of food. The stares grew more intense. The staff huddled near the counter, whispering nervously but still hesitant to intervene. Eli plopped back into the booth with a grunt, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His belly had ballooned outward, round and tight, visibly sagging over the waistband of his pants. Every breath came with a slight wheeze. David raised an eyebrow. “Starting to slow down?” Eli shook his head defiantly, though his movements had noticeably slowed. He rubbed his belly absentmindedly, then grimaced as he leaned forward to grab another plate. But as he stood to return to the buffet again, he paused. His legs felt heavier. His swollen stomach swayed, throwing off his balance. He winced slightly as he shifted his weight. David noticed immediately. “Getting a little hard to move, huh?” Eli grunted, leaning back against the booth, one hand bracing his overstuffed gut. He patted it absently, contemplating his next move. “I could stay here… and you could bring me plates,” Eli muttered, eyeing David. David chuckled. “Oh no, this is your mission.” Eli’s eyes flicked toward the buffet. Another option sparked in his mind. “Or…” he murmured, “…I could just eat straight from the buffet.” David leaned forward, grinning. “Now that’s the Eli I know.” Eli’s grip tightened on the edge of the table. The decision hung in the air—would he stay seated and let David serve him, or take things into his own hands and devour the buffet directly?","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_non_vore.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^David starts bringing the plates",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_non_vore.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli decides to eat directly from buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_non_vore.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_non_vore.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Buffet_vore":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The buffet was alive with the chatter of customers and the clinking of cutlery, but none of that mattered to Eli. His eyes gleamed as he stared at the endless rows of food.David leaned back comfortably in their booth, sipping his drink with a smirk.“Alright, Eli. Go nuts.”Eli didn’t need to be told twice.He grabbed a tray and made his way to the buffet, moving with eager determination. He started off relatively normal—loading up a few plates with generous portions of fried chicken, pasta, and mashed potatoes.But it didn’t stop there.Eli returned to the buffet over and over, each time stacking more plates onto his tray.Two plates. Four plates. Six plates.Soon, he was balancing multiple trays stacked high with food. Piles of ribs, greasy burgers, fried rice, lasagna, and entire roasted chickens threatened to topple over with every step.Back at the booth, David watched with mild amusement.Eli slammed the trays onto the table and immediately dug in.He devoured everything in sight.Forks and knives became unnecessary. Eli shoveled food into his mouth with both hands, slurping down pasta, tearing into ribs, and gulping down meats whole.His eating was rapid and relentless—gulp, chew, swallow, repeat.David picked at a small plate of salad, watching with a raised eyebrow.“You know, people are starting to stare,” David commented casually.And they were.Nearby diners had paused mid-bite, whispering and pointing in disbelief.A family at the next table watched with wide eyes as Eli shoved entire chicken legs into his mouth, crunching through bone without slowing down.Across the room, a waiter leaned in to whisper to another staff member.“Is… is that allowed?” the waiter asked, glancing nervously at Eli’s growing pile of empty plates.“It’s all-you-can-eat,” the other muttered, though he didn’t sound convinced.Eli paid no attention.His belly began to swell, pressing tightly against his shirt.At first, it was subtle.But with each trip to the buffet, each tray of food, his stomach grew larger.It pressed against the edge of the table, stretching his shirt taut.GRRRROOOAN.His gut let out a deep, ominous growl as it expanded outward, rounding and sagging over his waistband.Eli grunted, shifting in his seat to make room.But he wasn’t slowing down.Back to the buffet. More trays. More plates.His swollen belly wobbled as he walked, the strain becoming more noticeable.David chuckled.“Starting to slow down there, champ?”Eli shot him a glare but didn’t answer, too focused on cramming more food into his mouth.By now, the entire dining area had noticed.Murmurs rippled through the room.Staff exchanged uneasy glances.One waiter hesitantly approached the manager.“Should… should we say something?”The manager watched Eli with a tense jaw.“Let’s wait. Maybe he’ll stop.”But Eli didn’t stop.He kept eating.And his belly kept growing.Eventually, Eli’s stomach was so massive that standing up became difficult.He grunted, struggling to lift himself from the booth, his belly wobbling and sloshing heavily with every movement.David raised an eyebrow.“Having some trouble there?”Eli shot him a warning look, but it was clear—his gut was weighing him down.Breathing heavier now, Eli paused, debating his next move.","\n","ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"buffet_vore","re":true},["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_vore.0.9.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^David starts bringing plates ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_vore.0.10.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli eats directly from buffet ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_vore.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.9.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedBackInT4"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet_vore.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.10.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedUncomf"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"County_Fair":["ev",{"VAR?":"fat_bufet_belly"},"/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle chirping of birds filled the cool morning air.

His breathing had grown deeper, slower, but his eyes still burned with hunger. He gave his stomach a few firm pats, then turned his gaze to David. “Alright,” Eli grunted, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth. “Your turn. Start bringing me food.” David raised an eyebrow, but there was a glint of amusement in his eyes. “Seriously?” Eli’s only response was to open his mouth wide and point inside, as if daring David to question him. David sighed dramatically but stood up, muttering under his breath, “Fine, but you owe me for this.” He made his way to the buffet, grabbing a tray and piling it high with every dish within reach. Mountains of fried chicken, greasy slabs of ribs, overloaded pasta dishes, and thick wedges of cake. By the time David returned, the tray was bending under the weight. Eli didn’t even glance at what was on the plates. He grabbed the nearest dish, tipped it over his open mouth, and let the food cascade in. Entire portions of pasta and meats vanished down his throat with wet, sloppy gulps. Sauces dripped down his chin, but Eli didn’t care. His only pause was to wave impatiently at David. “Faster,” Eli grunted between mouthfuls. “You’re slowing me down.” David rolled his eyes but turned back to the buffet. Trip after trip, David kept hauling trays stacked high with food. Each time, Eli barely acknowledged him, simply grabbing plate after plate and dumping them straight into his maw. Occasionally, he stuffed entire drumsticks and ribs into his mouth, gnawing them down to the bone in seconds. His belly, already massive, stretched even further, groaning under the strain of the endless feast. The atmosphere in the buffet began to shift. Customers started whispering, glancing over at the increasingly chaotic scene. A child tugged on her mother’s sleeve, pointing at Eli with wide eyes. The mother quickly turned her away. At the buffet counter, staff scrambled to refill the rapidly emptying trays, but they were falling behind. Hot trays that once gleamed with fresh food were now barren, scraps clinging to their surfaces. A manager leaned over to a group of waiters, speaking in hushed tones. “Someone needs to talk to him,” the manager hissed, eyeing Eli nervously. The waiters exchanged panicked glances. No one volunteered. Meanwhile, David dragged yet another overloaded tray back to the booth, sweat beading on his forehead. His shirt clung to his back, and his steps had slowed noticeably. “Eli, this is, what, the twentieth tray?” David panted, setting it down with a thud. “Can I sit for a second?” Eli ignored him. He was too focused on pouring an entire plate of cheesy pasta into his mouth, swallowing without even chewing. Then he paused, noticing something. Across from their booth, in the next section, a young man sat alone, his eyes locked on Eli. His face was flushed, his breathing slightly quickened. He didn’t blink as he watched Eli’s gluttonous display, fixated on the way Eli’s belly swelled larger with every bite. Eli met the man’s gaze. A slow, knowing grin crept across Eli’s face. He shifted in his seat, spreading his legs to give his bloated belly more room, and gave it a heavy, exaggerated slap. THWUMP. The man flinched, swallowing hard. Eli chuckled and gave him a playful wink. Then, with deliberate slowness, he grabbed a plate of greasy ribs and messily devoured them, licking his fingers in a way that felt intentionally provocative. The young man’s eyes widened, his face going even redder, but he couldn’t look away. David returned with another tray, slamming it down. He was out of breath, drenched in sweat, and glaring at Eli. “Seriously… I need… to sit.” Eli, still smirking, leaned back and stretched his arms, causing his belly to bulge even more. David wiped his forehead and leaned against the booth, catching his breath. The tension in the room thickened. The buffet staff huddled together, whispering urgently, casting anxious glances toward Eli.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Waiter tries to stop Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The customer offers help",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidWipedTheSwe"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackInT5"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliShiftedInTheB":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli shifted in the booth, his belly groaning with pressure, but his hunger still burned hot. He planted his hands on the table and pushed himself up with a strained grunt. David watched him with a smirk, leaning back comfortably. “Oh oh…” David murmured to himself, watching Eli lumber toward the buffet. Eli’s massive gut swayed with each heavy step, brushing against tables and chairs, knocking them slightly out of place. Diners fell silent, staring in stunned disbelief as Eli approached the buffet like a predator eyeing prey. Without hesitation, Eli grabbed a large serving ladle from the nearest tray and began scooping heaps of steaming food directly into his mouth. Mashed potatoes, pasta, casseroles—SPLURK, GLOMP, GULP—each serving vanished almost instantly. But Eli wasn’t slowing down. His motions grew faster, more aggressive. The ladle moved in a blur, overfilled with food, until—GLNK!—he accidentally bit down and swallowed it whole. Eli paused briefly, feeling the ladle slide down his throat. “…Hmph.” Shrugging, he plunged both hands into the food, grabbing fistfuls of steaming dishes. He crammed everything into his mouth—greasy fried chicken, ribs, pasta, thick slabs of lasagna. Whole chicken legs and breaded cutlets disappeared in a single bite, bones and all, crunching loudly as they slid down his gullet. When he came across trays of saucy or liquid dishes, Eli simply grabbed the entire metal container, raised it over his head, and tilted it forward. Hot gravy and stews splashed into his mouth, streams of sauce dripping down his chin. The metallic clatter of empty trays echoed through the hall as Eli methodically cleared one after another. His approach was mechanical—clean a tray, toss it aside, move to the next. His stomach bulged, swelling with each bite. The tight skin creaked and groaned, inflating outward, forcing Eli to adjust his stance. Eventually, his belly grew so massive that it dragged along the ground, forcing him to stand sideways and awkwardly shuffle forward, dragging his overfilled gut behind him. The restaurant was in chaos. Patrons stared in horror and disbelief. Some scrambled to gather their belongings and leave, while others just sat frozen, unsure of what they were witnessing. Behind the buffet counter, the staff huddled in panic. “He’s eating everything!” a waiter hissed, peeking over the counter. “We can’t just stand here!” another snapped. The manager wiped sweat from his forehead, eyes locked on Eli as he devoured another entire tray of fried rice. “Should we call security?” one staff member whispered. The manager hesitated. His eyes darted between the destruction and the few remaining customers. “Maybe… maybe we can handle this ourselves.” Another waiter paled. “Ourselves?! Look at him! He’s… he’s a monster!” Eli continued his rampage, oblivious to the frightened staff. He tore through another set of trays, sauce dripping from his chin, his enormous belly now dragging across the floor with a wet, sloshing sound. The manager gritted his teeth, weighing his options.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Manager calls security",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Staff decides to intervene",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theManagerWipedS"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theManagerClench"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT4":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back in the booth, his hands resting on his already bloated stomach. The empty plates and bowls scattered around him barely made a dent in his hunger.David sat across from him, casually sipping his drink, amused by the destruction Eli had already caused.Eli let out a frustrated groan.“This is taking too long,” he muttered, eyeing the buffet with impatience.David smirked.“Well, maybe if you didn’t try to balance six plates at once, you wouldn’t drop half of it before you got back here.”Eli shot him a glare.“Then you go get it.”David raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”Eli leaned forward, his belly groaning as it pressed harder against the table.“You heard me. If you’re just gonna sit there sipping your little drink, the least you can do is be useful. Bring me more food.”David chuckled.“Oh, so now I’m your waiter?”Eli grinned.“More like a lifeline. I’m starving, David.”David sighed dramatically, pushing himself up from the booth.“Fine. But I swear, if anyone asks, I’m not with you.”Eli laughed, slapping his gut with a loud THWUMP.“Yeah, because I’m real easy to miss!”David shook his head and headed toward the buffet.Meanwhile, around them, the atmosphere in the restaurant began to shift.At a nearby table, a family sat in uncomfortable silence.The mother leaned in toward her husband, whispering under her breath.“Look at him… he hasn’t stopped eating since we got here.”The father frowned, stealing a glance at Eli as he greedily devoured the last of the food on his plate.“I’ve never seen anyone eat like that. It’s… not normal.”Their young daughter tugged on her mother’s sleeve.“Mommy, is that man sick?”Her mother quickly shushed her.“No, sweetie. Just… eat your food.”But her eyes remained on Eli, concern creeping into her expression.At another table, a group of coworkers sat in awkward silence, their half-finished plates forgotten.One of them, a man in his 40s, leaned closer to the group.“This… this doesn’t feel right.”“What do you mean?” one of his colleagues asked, nervously glancing toward Eli.The man wiped his mouth with a napkin.“I don’t know. Something about that guy… the way he’s eating. It’s like he can’t stop.”A woman across from him nodded slowly.“Yeah, it’s making me really uncomfortable. Like something bad is about to happen.”Another man, trying to lighten the mood, chuckled nervously.“Oh, come on. It’s an all-you-can-eat buffet. Maybe he’s just getting his money’s worth.”But the older man shook his head.“No. I’m telling you. That’s not normal.”He stood up abruptly, grabbing his coat.“Come on. Let’s get out of here.”The group hesitated, exchanging uneasy looks before silently agreeing. Chairs scraped against the floor as they quickly left, casting one last glance at Eli.Eli, of course, paid them no mind.David returned, arms full of stacked plates, and dropped them heavily onto the table.“There. Happy?”Eli didn’t answer. He immediately started dumping entire plates of food into his mouth, barely bothering to chew.GULP.Gone.GULP.Another one vanished.David leaned against the booth, watching in disbelief.“You know, you could at least pretend to have manners.”Eli snorted.“Manners are for people who aren’t starving to death!”David sighed and turned back toward the buffet, muttering under his breath.Around them, more customers began shifting uncomfortably in their seats.A couple seated by the window leaned in close.“Look at him. His stomach’s getting… huge,” the woman whispered, her eyes wide.The man frowned.“Yeah, I swear it wasn’t that big when we got here.”The woman bit her lip.“We should go. I don’t want to be here if he…” she trailed off, unable to finish the thought.The man nodded.“Let’s go.”They quietly gathered their things and slipped out, avoiding looking at Eli.Meanwhile, Eli’s stomach had begun to swell even larger.The wooden table creaked ominously.CRRACK.The edge of the table suddenly snapped under the pressure of Eli’s expanding belly.Wood splintered as his gut spilled forward, covering more of the table and pushing against the booth walls.Eli didn’t even blink.David stumbled back to the table, panting, dropping off another overloaded tray.“You’re gonna kill me, Eli,” David muttered, rubbing his aching arms.“Stop whining. You’re doing great,” Eli grinned, opening his mouth wide.David sighed and leaned against the wall, barely able to stand. Behind the buffet, the staff huddled together, watching Eli with wide eyes.A young waiter clutched his serving tray tightly.“He’s eating everything! We can’t keep up!”Another server leaned in, panicked.“What are we supposed to do? We’re running out of food!”The manager, a stocky man with a stained apron, wiped sweat from his forehead.“We need to say something. This can’t continue.”“You go talk to him!” one of the waiters blurted out.The manager stiffened.“…Maybe we wait a bit. See if he stops.”The staff exchanged nervous glances.“Yeah, and what if he doesn’t?” another asked.They all looked back at Eli, who was now stuffing an entire plate of ribs into his mouth.“God help us…” the manager muttered.  At a booth nearby, a young man sat alone, completely mesmerized by Eli.His eyes followed every movement—every gulp, every stretch of Eli’s swollen belly.His face was flushed, breathing uneven.Eli caught his stare.A slow, knowing grin spread across Eli’s face.Maintaining eye contact, Eli grabbed a massive piece of meat and slowly bit into it, deliberately letting grease and juices drip down his chin.The young man’s breath caught in his throat, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.Eli chuckled to himself.David, exhausted, finally slumped into the booth, sweat dripping down his face.“I can’t… carry another tray,” David panted.Eli barely acknowledged him, licking his fingers.“Fine.

Guess you’ll have to figure something out.” Eli glared but didn’t argue. With a strained grunt, he heaved himself up from the booth, his stomach wobbling heavily with the effort. “I’ll make this easier for everyone,” he muttered, already lumbering toward the buffet.Eli approached the buffet with slow, deliberate steps. Without hesitation, he grabbed the largest serving ladle he could find. He dunked it deep into a tray of macaroni and cheese and flung the heaping portion into his mouth. GULP. Gone. Another scoop. GULP. Another. He moved systematically, tray by tray, wiping out the entire buffet line. Mashed potatoes, fried chicken, pasta, gravy—nothing was safe. He dug into a tray of meatballs, loading scoop after scoop into his gaping maw. The loud CLANG of the ladle scraping the bottom of empty trays echoed through the now-quiet restaurant. But in his frenzy, he didn’t realize he had scooped too deeply—CLUNK. The entire ladle slipped into his mouth. GULP. Gone. Eli paused, blinking slowly. He rubbed his chest thoughtfully. “…Huh.” He briefly hesitated, then lazily shrugged and plunged his bare hands into the next tray, scooping out sticky piles of cheesy pasta and shoving it into his mouth. When he reached soups and gravies, he grabbed the entire metal trays, tilted them back, and poured the hot liquids directly into his throat. SLUUUURP. The empty trays clattered to the floor with loud metallic clangs.As Eli devoured more and more, his belly began to swell rapidly. It pushed further out, rounding and groaning as it expanded. The seams of his shirt stretched tight, buttons creaking. His gut sagged forward, drooping lower with each heaving breath. Soon, it grew so large that it began to drag along the floor behind him, leaving a greasy trail of crumbs and sauce. THUD. He knocked over a buffet table with his stomach but didn’t stop. Guests stared in horror. A mother clutched her child closer. “Oh my God…” she whispered. A family near the back huddled together. “Mom, is that man okay?” a little boy whispered. The mother grabbed his hand tightly. “We’re leaving. Now.” Chairs scraped the floor as people hurried toward the exits.Behind the buffet, the staff had gone pale, huddled together. One waiter trembled, gripping the edge of the counter. “H-he just… swallowed the ladle.” The manager, sweating, stared in disbelief. “This isn’t happening…” Another waiter leaned in, panicked. “What are we supposed to do? He’s eating everything!” The manager’s eyes darted toward Eli, now plowing through the final trays. “We need to stop him. But how? Should we call security?” Silence. “Or… should we try to handle it ourselves?” The staff exchanged terrified glances.Eli let out a deep, rumbling BURRRRP that shook the walls. He turned slowly toward the buffet counter, where the staff cowered. His belly was now so massive it sloshed and dragged heavily behind him, filling most of the aisle. Step by step, he began shuffling forward, eyes locked on the trembling employees. The floor creaked with each heavy step. David watched from a distance, frozen. “Oh, no…” he muttered. The staff backed away, pressing themselves against the wall. The manager’s voice was barely a whisper. “Do we… call security?” But Eli was already moving closer, his stomach rumbling like distant thunder.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedUncomf.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Manager calls security ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedUncomf.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Staff tries to stop Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedUncomf.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theRestaurantWas"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedUncomf.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theRestaurantWas1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theSoftMorningLi1":["ev",{"VAR?":"fat_bufet_belly"},"!","/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^The soft morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across Eli's bedroom.

His belly gurgled again, louder this time, making the mattress vibrate beneath him. \"Ughhh…\" Eli whined, rubbing his empty stomach. \"So hungry...\" He sat up, blinking sleepily before glancing at the clock. \"Okay, that’s it,\" he muttered and stumbled out of bed, padding down the hall.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.5"},null]}],"nop","\n",{"->":"County_Fair_2"},{"#f":1}],"davidWipedTheSwe":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David wiped the sweat from his brow, his arms aching from hauling tray after tray of food. He slumped against the edge of the booth, panting heavily. But Eli wasn’t satisfied. Not even close. “David!” Eli barked, pounding a meaty fist on the table. The plates rattled from the force. “I’m starving! Quit slacking and get me more!” David groaned, dragging himself to his feet. “Unbelievable…” he muttered under his breath, stumbling back toward the buffet. At the counter, the staff huddled together, voices low but urgent. “That’s it. Someone has to say something,” the manager hissed. “He’s scaring the customers!” another waiter whispered, glancing nervously at Eli’s enormous, exposed belly bulging over the table. After a tense silence, one unfortunate waiter was pushed forward. “Go. Just... ask him to stop.” The waiter swallowed hard and slowly approached Eli’s booth, wringing his hands. “Um... s-sir?” he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. Eli didn’t even look up, still shoveling food into his mouth. “Sir, we... w-we must kindly ask you to stop eating. You’ve consumed more than enough, and, well... your exposed stomach is making some guests... uncomfortable.” The words hung in the air like a death sentence. Eli slowly lowered his latest plate, licking sauce from his fingers. His eyes flicked lazily toward the trembling waiter. Then, without warning, Eli leaned forward, casting a heavy shadow over the man. He opened his mouth wide—unnaturally wide. His jaws stretched impossibly far, revealing a cavernous, dark maw that seemed to pull the very air around it. The waiter’s eyes bulged in pure terror. “You see this?” Eli growled, voice low and rumbling. “If you and the rest of your little friends don’t start bringing me food, you’re all going in next.” The waiter stumbled back, nearly tripping over his own feet. “I—I’ll tell them!” he squeaked and fled toward the kitchen. Moments later, the staff hesitantly began approaching Eli’s booth, balancing trays stacked high with food. One by one, they nervously placed them down. But Eli’s belly had grown so massive, it had already crushed part of the table and the booth itself. The wood splintered under the pressure, his gut spilling outward, dominating the space. The staff had no choice but to start placing trays directly on top of Eli’s ballooned stomach. The plates wobbled precariously on the taut, round surface. Eli grinned wickedly and tipped another plate into his mouth. David, now free from his food-hauling duties, casually slid back into the booth—what was left of it, anyway. He leaned back comfortably, watching the chaos unfold with clear amusement. “See?” David smirked, “This is much more efficient.” Across the dining room, guests began to rise from their tables, whispering anxiously and making their way to the exit. Chairs scraped loudly against the floor as people left in a steady stream. No one wanted to be around for what might come next. Except for one. The young man from the neighboring booth had moved closer, unable to resist. His face was flushed, his breathing shallow. Almost hypnotically, he reached out a trembling hand and gently pressed it against Eli’s swollen, hot belly. He rubbed in slow, tentative circles, his eyes locked in fascination. Eli noticed. He chuckled, letting out a deep, guttural belch that rattled the plates on his stomach. The young man flinched but didn’t pull away. Tray after tray kept arriving, the buffet staff now moving mechanically, pale and terrified. Eli’s belly swelled larger and larger, creaking ominously as it pressed outward, warping the remains of the booth. Plates and trays teetered on his stomach, barely balanced. Then, silence. No more trays came. One of the waiters, ghostly pale, nervously approached the towering mass of Eli and the wreckage around him. “Uh… s-sir?” the waiter quivered. “W-we… w-we’re out of food…” The dining hall was dead silent. David slowly turned to look at Eli, raising an eyebrow. The young man’s hand froze mid-rub, eyes darting nervously toward Eli. Eli’s eyes narrowed, a dark grin spreading across his face.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidWipedTheSwe.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli requests the equipment",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidWipedTheSwe.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^David stops the chaos",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidWipedTheSwe.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliSlowlyTurnedH"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidWipedTheSwe.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.elisMassiveBelly"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT5":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back in the shattered booth, his enormous belly spilling over the crushed table and sagging toward the floor. Plates and trays were scattered around him, and David slumped against the wall, completely exhausted, wiping sweat from his face. But Eli wasn’t slowing down. “David! More!” Eli barked, his deep voice rattling the remaining glasses on the tables. David groaned, barely able to stand. “Eli, I swear, if I have to carry one more tray—” Before David could finish, a hesitant voice interrupted. “U-um… I-I can help.” Both Eli and David turned. Standing awkwardly beside the booth was the young man from the nearby table—the one who had been watching Eli with wide, fascinated eyes. His face was flushed deep red, his hands fidgeting nervously at his sides. “I-I mean… if that’s okay. I… I could help bring more food,” the man stammered, stealing glances at Eli’s massive, glistening belly. David blinked in surprise, but then shrugged, too exhausted to care. “Sure. Knock yourself out,” David muttered, sinking back into the booth. The man’s eyes lit up. He spun on his heel and practically ran to the buffet, grabbing a tray and piling it high with anything he could find. He returned in record time, breathless, the tray overflowing. With trembling hands, he leaned forward and carefully tilted a plate of greasy pasta into Eli’s wide-open mouth. GULP. It vanished instantly. The man shivered, eyes locked on Eli’s throat as it bulged with the massive swallow. Without thinking, he reached out and gently stroked Eli’s taut, swollen belly. His fingers trailed across the stretched skin, lingering for a second too long. Eli raised an eyebrow and grinned. “Oh, you like that, huh?” Eli teased, patting his own belly, causing it to jiggle under the man’s hand. The young man’s face burned even redder, but he couldn’t stop himself. “I-I’ll get more!” he stammered and bolted back to the buffet. David smirked. “Well, looks like you’ve got yourself a fan club.” Eli chuckled deeply, his belly wobbling. The young man returned again and again, each time with more trays of food. He fed Eli eagerly, dumping plates of food directly into his mouth, and each time, he let his hand glide over Eli’s ballooning gut, marveling at how it stretched larger and larger. Eli leaned into it, opening his mouth wide and grinning between bites. “You’re doing a better job than David,” Eli teased, licking sauce off his lips. “Keep it coming, sweetheart.” The man nearly dropped the tray, his hands shaking, but he quickly recovered, running back for more.The chaos was noticed by the staff. A waiter, pale and trembling, finally mustered the courage to approach Eli’s booth. “E-excuse me, sir,” the waiter stammered, his voice barely holding steady. “Y-you’ve eaten more than enough. I-I’m going to have to ask you to… stop.” Eli slowly turned to him, his grin fading into something darker. Without a word, he shot out a thick hand and grabbed the waiter by the front of his shirt, yanking him forward effortlessly. The waiter let out a startled yelp. Eli leaned in, his mouth stretching open impossibly wide, revealing rows of teeth and a dark, cavernous throat. With slow, deliberate force, Eli pushed the waiter’s head forward, just barely inside his massive mouth. Hot breath washed over the terrified man. The waiter let out a strangled scream, his limbs flailing. After a tense second, Eli pulled him back and dropped him to the floor with a dismissive grunt. The waiter scrambled backward on all fours, eyes wide in horror, before leaping to his feet and sprinting away. Eli let out a booming, guttural laugh, his stomach bouncing. David shook his head with a smirk. “Subtle.” The young man, now emboldened by the scene, eagerly returned with another tray, but his face fell as he approached. “I… I think we’re out of food,” he mumbled, crestfallen. Eli paused, licking his lips thoughtfully. His belly let out a deep, ominous GRRRRROOOWL. David leaned forward with a sigh. “Oh, great. Now what?” The young man hesitated, then nervously spoke up. “M-maybe… maybe we could, um… feed him the furniture?” he suggested, voice shaking but hopeful. “Or, you know, the decorations?” David’s eyes narrowed. “Seriously?” Eli chuckled darkly, his eyes glinting with interest. David groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Or,” David said firmly, “we end this now. You’ve caused enough damage. Let’s figure out how to get you home.” Eli huffed but leaned back, rubbing his stretched stomach.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedBackInT5.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Feed him everything",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedBackInT5.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Stop the rampage",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedBackInT5.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidGroanedOhCo"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedBackInT5.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackInT6"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theManagerWipedS":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The manager wiped sweat from his forehead, staring helplessly as Eli tore through the buffet, devouring tray after tray of food. “This is insane…” he muttered, gripping his phone tightly. With shaking hands, he dialed a number. “Yeah, security? We need help. Now.” Minutes later, the front doors slammed open. Two large security guards in crisp uniforms strode into the restaurant. Their arms bulged beneath their sleeves, and their heavy boots thudded across the floor. The taller one adjusted his cap and scanned the room. “That the guy?” he grunted, nodding toward Eli, who was busy shoveling food into his mouth. “Yeah,” the manager stammered. “He… he won’t stop eating. Please, get him out of here.” The guards exchanged a glance. “No problem.” They marched toward Eli with heavy steps. Eli didn’t even glance at them. He leaned over the buffet counter, pouring an entire tray of mashed potatoes straight into his mouth. The first guard cleared his throat. “Sir,” he barked. “You need to leave. Now.” Eli ignored him, grabbing a metal tray of fried chicken and chomping into it without hesitation. The second guard narrowed his eyes. “Hey! I said you need to leave!” Still nothing. Growing irritated, the second guard stepped forward and tapped Eli on the shoulder. Eli froze. The buffet fell silent. Slowly, Eli set down the tray and turned his massive form to face them. His belly groaned as it shifted, sagging heavily toward the floor. Both guards tried to maintain their tough expressions, but sweat beaded on their foreheads, dripping from beneath their caps. Eli loomed over them, his massive gut rising and falling with each heavy breath. “What?” Eli growled, voice low and rumbling. The taller guard straightened up. “You’re done here. You need to leave the premises.” Eli’s eyes narrowed. “Oh yeah?” he smirked. “Why don’t you make me?” The guards hesitated, exchanging a quick, nervous glance. “Fine.” They both lunged forward, each grabbing one of Eli’s thick arms. They pulled. Nothing happened. Eli didn’t budge an inch. The guards strained, gritting their teeth, muscles bulging as they tried to drag him. Eli grinned. “Maybe you should lift this first,” he chuckled, slapping his gigantic belly with a loud THWUMP. The guards looked at each other, then down at the enormous gut spilling across the floor. Reluctantly, they crouched down and shoved their arms under the massive dome of flesh. With visible strain, they heaved upward. GRRRRRNNNK! The bloated mass lifted just a few inches off the ground. Eli inhaled deeply—his chest expanding, his belly stretching tighter— Then he lurched forward. BOOOOOM! His colossal stomach slammed outward, crashing into both guards. THUD! They flew backward like ragdolls, landing hard on their backs. Before they could scramble up, Eli’s belly came down with a heavy SLAM, pinning them beneath its massive weight. “MMMPH!” The guards squirmed helplessly, limbs flailing. Eli let out a deep, guttural laugh, his belly jiggling with each breath. “Nice try, boys.” He patted his stomach, causing another wave of flesh to press down on the struggling men. Eli casually turned back to the buffet and resumed eating, grabbing handfuls of food and shoving it into his mouth. The manager and remaining staff peeked nervously from behind the counter, too terrified to intervene. David slowly walked over, hands in his pockets, surveying the destruction. “Well, you’ve flattened the security team. Happy now?” Eli let out a contented grunt, stuffing an entire roasted chicken into his mouth. David sighed. “Alright, now we need to figure out how to get you home.” Eli barely acknowledged him, his eyes still locked on the buffet. David rubbed his temple. “Look, you have two choices. One—you activate your metabolism and burn all this off. Or two—I call my buddy with the truck. Again.” Eli grunted, licking grease off his fingers. David followed his gaze. “Oh no. Don’t even think about it.” Eli’s eyes were locked on the kitchen doors, where terrified chefs peeked out from behind the window.

The staff huddled in terror behind the counter, their faces pale.  The manager, trembling, fumbled for his phone.  “That’s it. I’m calling security.”  His hands shook as he dialed.  “Security? We need help at King’s Buffet—*right now!*”  Moments later, the entrance doors slammed open.  Two massive security guards stormed in, their uniforms tight over their bulging muscles.  They stopped dead in their tracks at the sight of Eli.  The taller one leaned over to his partner.  “Uh… what the hell is that?”  The manager rushed over, panicked.  “*Please!* You have to stop him! He’s eating *everything!*”  The first guard cracked his knuckles, masking his hesitation.  “We’ve got this.”  They strode toward Eli, who was still casually pouring entire trays of food into his mouth, ignoring the commotion.  The first guard cleared his throat.  “Sir, step away from the buffet and leave the premises.”  No response.  Eli grabbed another tray and shoved the entire contents into his mouth.  The second guard stepped closer, his tone sharper.  “*HEY!* I said, step away!”  Still nothing.  The second guard growled, reaching out to tap Eli on the shoulder.  Eli slowly stopped chewing.  The restaurant fell into a suffocating silence.  David, standing at a safe distance, muttered under his breath.  “Oh boy… here we go.”  Eli carefully set the empty tray down.  Then, with agonizing slowness, he turned his massive body to face them.  His enormous belly *groaned* as it shifted forward, forcing both guards to stumble backward.  Eli stared at them blankly.  “…Can I help you?” he asked flatly.  The guards tried to hold their ground, but sweat was already glistening on their foreheads.  “You need to leave. *Now,*” the first guard ordered, though his voice wavered.  Eli squinted.  “What was that? Come closer. I can’t hear you.”  The second guard scowled.  “Don’t play dumb!”  Frustrated, both guards lunged forward and grabbed Eli by the arms.  Eli blinked slowly.  Then, in an instant, he *ripped* his arms free and grabbed both guards.  Before they could scream—  *GULP.*  He shoved them both into his mouth and swallowed them whole.  The restaurant went dead silent.  Then—  “*HE ATE THEM!*”  Panic erupted.  Guests screamed and fled toward the exits, knocking over chairs and tables.  The remaining staff bolted for the kitchen, shoving each other aside to escape into the back.  But Eli didn’t chase them.  He calmly continued eating, emptying the last of the buffet.  David, standing nearby, snorted.  “Well, that worked out great.”  Eli let out a deep, rumbling *BURRRRP* that shook the remaining walls.  But Eli wasn’t finished.  He turned his head slowly toward the swinging kitchen doors.  David frowned.  “Oh no… Eli, don’t.”  Eli’s grin widened.  Without hesitation, he lumbered forward, dragging his massive gut behind him.  He *smashed* through the kitchen doors, the frame splintering under his weight.  The staff screamed in terror as they scrambled to hide behind counters and shelves.  “*PLEASE!*” one of the cooks shrieked.  But Eli didn’t slow down.  He reached over the counter and grabbed two employees, lifting them effortlessly.  *GULP. GULP.*  Gone.  The remaining staff tried to run, but Eli was too fast.  One by one, they vanished down his throat.  *GULP.*  The manager, hiding in the corner, trembled as Eli’s shadow loomed over him.  “N-no, please—”  *GULP.*  The kitchen fell silent.  Eli wiped his mouth lazily, patting his enormous belly, now swollen beyond belief.  *GRRRROOOAN.*  His gut groaned and sloshed, stretching taut and veiny, filling half the destroyed kitchen.  David cautiously stepped through the wreckage.  “Okay… now we have a *real* problem.”  Eli chuckled, giving his massive belly a heavy slap.  David sighed and raised two fingers.  “Option one—you activate your metabolism and burn it off.”  Eli groaned in protest.  “Or option two—I call the truck. Again. But this time… yeah, it’s gonna be a *whole* thing.”  Eli grinned.  David rubbed his face.  “Your choice.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theRestaurantWas.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Activate metabolism ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theRestaurantWas.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Call the truck ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theRestaurantWas.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliSlumpedHeavil"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theRestaurantWas.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidShookHisHea"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliSatBloatedAnd":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli sat, bloated and towering over the broken booth, his belly swollen to an impossible size. Plates, trays, and scraps of food surrounded him in a chaotic mess. David stood nearby, arms crossed, watching with a mix of exhaustion and disbelief.Then, a quiet, trembling voice cut through the stillness.“I-I can help…”David turned to see the young man who had been sitting alone earlier. His face was flushed, and his hands fidgeted nervously.“I mean, if it’s alright… I could bring him more food?”David stared at him for a moment, blinking in disbelief.“…Seriously?”The man nodded eagerly.David let out a tired sigh and shrugged.“Sure. Be my guest.”The man practically bolted to the buffet, grabbing a tray and piling it high with food. He returned quickly, carefully tilting the tray to pour the food directly into Eli’s gaping mouth.Eli didn’t hesitate. He leaned in, inhaling the food effortlessly.Chunks of meat, pasta, and desserts slid down his throat in heavy, wet gulps.The young man’s hand lingered on Eli’s heaving belly, softly gliding across the taut, stretched skin.Eli let out a low hum of satisfaction.David watched, raising an eyebrow.“Oh, great. Now he’s got a fan club.”The man ignored him, rushing back for more food.Tray after tray, he fed Eli, dumping entire portions straight into his mouth.Sometimes, Eli leaned forward, letting the man practically shovel the food in. Other times, he tilted his head back as the man poured thick, heavy sauces and stews down his throat.Eli’s belly expanded further, groaning as it pressed against the shattered booth and began spilling into the aisle.David shook his head.“Well, at least I’m off the hook.”The man was relentless, running back and forth, grabbing tray after tray, feeding Eli as fast as he could.But eventually, he returned slowly, his face downcast, holding an empty tray.“There’s… there’s nothing left,” he mumbled.Eli blinked, pausing mid-breath.David smirked.“Well, I guess that’s it.”But the young man hesitated. Then, with a shy smile, he nervously offered, “W-well… if you’re still hungry… maybe I could be your dessert?”David coughed in shock.“You’ve gotta be kidding me.”Eli’s eyes narrowed, then widened in amusement.“…You’re serious?”The man eagerly nodded.Eli’s grin spread slowly.“Well… who am I to say no to dessert?”The man practically vibrated with excitement.“Oh my god, yes!”Without hesitation, he climbed onto Eli’s massive belly, sinking into the soft, warm flesh. He crawled up toward Eli’s open mouth.David watched, mouth slightly open.“I was joking.”The man looked back, grinning.“This is the best day of my life!”Eli chuckled and leaned his head back, opening his mouth wider.The man let himself slide in, feet first, giggling the whole way.“So warm… so soft…” his muffled voice echoed from inside.Eli closed his mouth and swallowed slowly.His belly shifted and sloshed, making space for its latest occupant.Eli let out a low sigh of contentment, patting his now enormous belly.David blinked slowly.“…What the hell is wrong with people?”But before David could say anything else, a wave of terrified screams erupted.Guests and staff were bolting for the exits, tipping over chairs and tables.Eli slowly turned his head, eyes narrowing.Then, in a sudden, booming voice, he roared,“WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU’RE GOING?!”The restaurant froze.Eli suddenly pushed himself up, faster than anyone expected, his massive body shifting with surprising speed.His belly wobbled and sloshed violently as he lunged forward.In a blur, his thick arms snatched two fleeing guests—CRUNCH! GULP!Gone.Screams filled the air.“RUN!” someone shrieked.Eli stomped forward, grabbing people left and right, shoving them into his mouth.A waiter tripped and scrambled to crawl away—SNAP! Eli grabbed his leg and yanked him up.GLLRK!Gone.David pressed himself against the wall, wide-eyed.“Eli!”But Eli didn’t hear him.The remaining staff, panicking, fled toward the kitchen, slamming the doors behind them.Eli’s eyes glinted.“Oh, you think that’ll stop me?”With a massive step forward, Eli smashed through the kitchen doors, splintering the frame.David watched in stunned silence.From the kitchen, muffled screams echoed—followed by the sounds of crashing metal, shattering glass, and loud, wet swallowing.GULP.CRASH.SCREAMS.Then—silence.Moments later, Eli slowly waddled back out into the dining area, his belly groaning and stretching impossibly wide, sagging heavily against the ground.David stared at him, completely expressionless.“…Feel better?”Eli lazily patted his swollen belly, making it ripple.“Much.”David let out a long sigh.“Okay, now how are we getting you home?”Eli raised an eyebrow, smirking.David pinched the bridge of his nose.“Option one—you activate your metabolism and burn it off.

His eyes narrowed, and a slow, wicked grin spread across his face. “Oh, you’re out of food, huh?” Eli rumbled. His deep voice reverberated through the emptying restaurant. The staff exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what to do. David remained slouched in the corner of the wrecked booth, watching with idle curiosity. Eli’s gaze flicked to the large artificial palm tree standing beside the ruined booth—a tacky decoration meant to give the buffet a “tropical” vibe. Without breaking eye contact with the staff, Eli slowly reached out, wrapped his thick fingers around the plastic trunk, and yanked it free from its base. The staff gasped. Eli casually lifted the artificial tree over his head and, with a sickening gulp, shoved it into his gaping mouth. The plastic leaves crumpled, the thick trunk bent, and the entire tree disappeared down his throat in one impossibly long swallow. A loud, wet GLLL-GGGLLK! echoed through the room. His stomach groaned, swelling even larger, the surface stretching tight and shiny. The room fell deathly silent. Eli let out a deep, satisfied BUUURRP that rattled the empty plates around him. He lazily patted his grotesquely swollen gut, which now loomed over the shattered remains of the table. “Still hungry,” Eli growled, narrowing his eyes at the stunned staff. “Start feeding me. Everything.” The staff didn’t hesitate this time. They scattered in all directions, frantically grabbing chairs, bar stools, trays, and anything not bolted to the floor. One waiter shakily dragged a full beverage dispenser toward Eli, sloshing soda everywhere. Another struggled to carry a cash register, arms trembling. Eli watched them with gleeful anticipation. One by one, the items were dumped into his waiting mouth. CLUNK! A metal chair vanished with a deep gulp. CRUNCH! A stack of trays shattered as they slid down his throat. GLURRKK! An entire countertop display rack of desserts disappeared in seconds. Eli’s belly surged outward, rumbling and groaning under the impossible weight. Its surface bulged and shifted, sloshing heavily as it spread across the floor. The booth was completely obliterated, replaced by Eli’s massive, wobbling stomach. David remained seated on a broken fragment of bench, arms crossed. He smirked as he watched the chaos unfold. The last remaining customers had fled in terror, the doors slamming behind them. Only a handful of pale, trembling employees remained, scrambling to keep Eli fed. The young man who had been watching Eli from the other booth was still there, standing closer now, mesmerized. His hand lightly caressed Eli’s bloated stomach, eyes wide with awe. Soon, there was nothing left to feed him. The restaurant was stripped bare—no furniture, no counters, not even decorations. Only cracked tiles and Eli’s enormous, heaving belly remained. The staff stood motionless, drenched in sweat, too afraid to speak. Eli let out a satisfied sigh, running his palms over his grotesquely stretched gut. “For today…” Eli rumbled, casting a shadow over the trembling staff, “…I’ll let you off the hook.” The employees didn’t move. One waiter looked moments away from fainting. David finally stood up, brushing dust off his pants. He stared at Eli, tilting his head thoughtfully. “Well, that was fun,” David said casually, “but… how exactly are we supposed to get you home?” Eli’s belly let out a deep, ominous GRRRRRROOOAN, shifting slightly as it spread out, knocking aside the last scraps of furniture. David sighed, rubbing his temple. “Okay, so we have two options,” he muttered. “Either you activate your metabolism and burn this off…” He glanced at the sheer size of Eli’s stomach and winced. “…or I call my buddy with the truck again.” Eli lazily grinned, shifting slightly as his enormous belly gurgled beneath him.

He darted off, grabbing the nearest wooden chair and dragging it toward Eli. “Open wide!” he beamed. Eli leaned forward, jaws stretching impossibly wide, and CHOMP!—the entire chair vanished in a single bite. The wooden legs cracked and splintered, echoing through the silent hall. David sighed in disbelief. “Unbelievable.” Without hesitation, the young man grabbed another chair, then another. David, rolling his eyes, eventually shrugged. “Fine. If it gets this over with…” Reluctantly, he joined in, hauling over tables and bar stools. CRUNCH! SNAP! GLOMP! Eli devoured everything they brought him. Whole chairs, tables, bar stools—each piece of furniture shattered between his teeth and slid down his throat. Decorative plants, framed pictures, lamps—gone. The walls shook as Eli gulped down heavier objects. Guests who had lingered too long bolted for the exit, screaming. “What is wrong with him?!” one shouted as the doors slammed behind them. The remaining staff didn’t dare intervene this time. They fled into the back rooms, barricading themselves in the kitchen, peeking out in terror. The young man’s face was flushed with excitement as he dragged a heavy display shelf over to Eli. Eli leaned forward, CRUNCH!, snapping it like a breadstick. David leaned against a half-broken counter, watching as the destruction continued. Soon, the dining hall was completely empty. Not a single chair, table, or decoration remained. Eli sat in the middle of the barren room, his belly now an impossibly enormous, swollen dome of flesh. It spread out in every direction, dominating the entire space. His skin was stretched tight, creaking under the weight of everything he had consumed. Eli let out a slow, rumbling BURRRRP that echoed through the bare hall. David slowly approached, surveying the destruction with a tired sigh.“Well,” David muttered, hands on his hips, “you’ve officially eaten an entire restaurant.”Eli lazily patted his bloated gut, causing it to ripple and creak.“Not bad,” Eli grunted, grinning.David shook his head. “Okay, big guy, we’ve got a problem.

They’re… uh, digestive tablets. Really powerful ones! I swear, they work like magic. They could help… you know, break everything down faster!”Eli blinked slowly, staring at the tiny bottle.David squinted at the label. “Seriously? You think a few little pills are going to fix this?” He gestured to Eli’s enormous belly.The young man nodded eagerly, holding the bottle out with shaky hands.Eli chuckled deeply, sending a slow ripple through his gut.“Well, I guess it’s worth a shot,” Eli rumbled, snatching the bottle from the man’s hands.David sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.“Okay, fine. So now we have three options.”He raised a finger.“One—activate your metabolism and burn this off.”He raised a second finger.“Two—I call the truck to haul you home.”Then he pointed at the nervous young man.“Or three—you take his magic digestion pills and hope they work.”Eli grinned, shaking the bottle thoughtfully.David crossed his arms. “Your call.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Activate metabolism ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Call for truck",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.7.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-2","flg":2},{"s":["^Try the 'magic' pills",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliSlumpedHeavil"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidShookHisHea"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidGroanedOhCo.0.c-2.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.7.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliTurnedTheSmal"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"elisMassiveBelly":[["^Eli’s massive belly groaned as he shifted in the wrecked booth, surrounded by empty plates, crushed furniture, and terrified employees.

Plates and broken furniture were crushed beneath the sheer weight of his bloated form. But his eyes were still locked on the double doors leading to the kitchen. David noticed the familiar, hungry glint in Eli’s eyes and groaned. “Oh no. Don’t even think about it.” Eli grinned slowly, licking his lips. “Just a little dessert before we go,” he rumbled, turning toward the kitchen. David threw up his hands. “Yeah, sure. What’s left to eat, the oven?” Eli didn’t answer. He shuffled forward, dragging his impossibly bloated belly behind him. His gut sloshed and groaned with each step, spreading out wider than his own arms could reach. As he approached the kitchen doors, it became clear that even the double doors were far too narrow for him. Eli tried squeezing through sideways, but his stomach pressed against the doorframe with a deep, wet squelch. He grunted in frustration. “Oh, come on…” Eli growled and pushed harder, his bulk straining against the frame. Inside the kitchen, chefs stared in silent horror. The doors buckled as Eli leaned in, the metal hinges creaking. His belly mashed into the doorway, pressing inward, causing the walls around the frame to crack and crumble. CRRRRACK! The plaster split, and the frame warped. With a guttural roar, Eli shoved forward with all his strength. BOOOOM! The entire section of the wall gave way, and Eli’s enormous belly exploded into the kitchen, knocking over racks of utensils, counters, and shelves. Pots and pans crashed to the floor. “RUN!” one of the chefs screamed. The kitchen staff scrambled in all directions, fleeing toward the storage rooms. Eli barely noticed. His attention was on the piles of ingredients and half-prepared dishes. Without hesitation, he began grabbing everything within reach—raw meat, bags of flour, crates of vegetables—and stuffing it all into his mouth. He didn’t chew. He didn’t care. Whole frozen chickens, sacks of rice, entire wheels of cheese—they all vanished into his endless maw. The kitchen was in chaos. Eli grabbed a massive pot of soup and dumped it into his mouth, swallowing the pot as well. His belly surged outward, creaking ominously as it inflated even larger, knocking over shelves and shattering countertops. But it still wasn’t enough. Eli’s head slowly turned toward the large metal door of the storage room. A wicked grin stretched across his face. David, watching from the dining hall, shook his head in disbelief. “Oh, for the love of… Eli, really?” Eli didn’t answer. He lumbered forward, his gut squelching and slapping against the floor. The storage room door barely held as Eli leaned into it. BOOM! The heavy door dented inward, then burst open. Eli squeezed through with effort, his belly flattening against the walls, shelves groaning under the pressure. Inside, the chefs cowered in the far corner, trembling. Eli didn’t even notice them. He grabbed full crates and shoved them into his mouth—sealed boxes of dried mashed potatoes, bulk containers of oil, giant sacks of sugar. Nothing was spared. Cardboard, plastic, glass—it all vanished with sickening GLOMP sounds. The room shook as his stomach expanded, spreading across the storage floor, pressing against the walls. CRACK. The walls buckled under the pressure. Somewhere beneath him, there were muffled screams and the faint, wet crunching of bones, but Eli ignored it. SLURP. Another crate disappeared. When the shelves were bare, Eli leaned back, letting out a thunderous, bone-rattling BURRRRP that echoed through the shattered storage room. Satisfied, he slowly turned, his enormous belly grinding against the walls, crushing what remained of the shelving. Then—BOOM!—he forced his way back out, bursting through the weakened wall into the ruined kitchen. In the corner of the storage room, three crushed chefs lay motionless, half-buried beneath the wreckage, their bodies flattened by Eli’s rampaging bulk. David stood in the middle of the destroyed dining hall, arms crossed. “Feeling better now?” David muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Eli lumbered forward, his stomach now so massive it dragged behind him, wobbling with every step. “Not bad,” Eli grunted, giving his belly a heavy slap. The shockwave made the broken chairs near David wobble. David rubbed his temple in frustration. “Okay, genius, now how exactly are we supposed to get you home?” Eli’s bloated form swayed slightly as he pondered the question. David raised two fingers. “Option one: You activate your metabolism and burn this off. Might take a while, but at least you’ll fit through the door.” Eli grunted. “Option two: I call my buddy with the truck. Again.” Eli tilted his head, considering. David raised an eyebrow.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLetOutADeepSa.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Activate the metabolism ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLetOutADeepSa.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Call the truck ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLetOutADeepSa.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliSlumpedHeavil"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLetOutADeepSa.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidShookHisHea"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliTurnedTheSmal":["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli turned the small bottle of digestion pills over in his hand, the tiny tablets rattling softly inside.David stood nearby, arms crossed, his face a mix of exhaustion and disbelief.“Seriously?” David scoffed. “You think that’s going to fix this?”The young man eagerly nodded, holding the bottle out with trembling hands.“They’re really strong!

BLUB.The sounds grew louder, wet and violent, echoing ominously in the empty hall.David tensed.“Uh… that doesn’t sound healthy.”Eli shifted uncomfortably.Then it started.His belly… moved.Just a little at first, a slow, ominous swelling.Eli looked down, eyes narrowing.“…Okay, wait.

SLORRRRK.David stared in shock.“Oh, I don’t think that’s how this works!”The young man gasped, covering his mouth.“Oh no… oh no…!”Eli’s stomach swelled violently, knocking over the shattered tables and chairs that remained. The bloated mass pushed outward, overtaking more of the floor.David snapped out of it.“RUN! NOW!”Without waiting, David grabbed the terrified young man by the arm and dragged him toward the exit.“DAVID!” Eli roared behind them. “DON’T LEAVE ME! DO SOMETHING!”But David didn’t look back.CRASH!Eli’s belly slammed into the walls, cracking them.David and the young man burst through the front doors, sprinting across the parking lot.They dove behind a parked car, gasping for breath.From behind them, the sounds grew louder—CRACK! GROOOAN!—and the restaurant trembled.Eli’s bloated body pressed against the walls.Windows shattered, and thick, fleshy mass began oozing through the frames.POP! CRACK!The double doors burst open as Eli’s gut forced its way out, sloshing and stretching.Inside, Eli screamed.“DAVID! HELP! DO SOMETHING!”David crouched lower behind the car.“I told you that was a bad idea!”The young man was trembling.“I-I didn’t think it’d do this!”BOOM! CRACK!The walls of the buffet split open. Eli’s enormous belly now filled almost the entire restaurant, pressing outward with unstoppable force.The roof groaned.Then—Silence.Everything stopped.The bubbling, the creaking—the sounds were gone.David blinked, frozen.“…Wait. Did it stop?”He slowly peeked over the hood of the car.“Eli?” David called out cautiously.No answer.Only silence.David took a step forward.Then—BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!The entire building exploded.A deafening shockwave tore through the parking lot.Chunks of bricks, wood, and metal flew in every direction.A tidal wave of half-digested food and debris sprayed across the lot, slamming into cars and smashing windows.David and the young man were thrown backward, hitting the pavement hard.For a moment, the world was just dust, smoke, and the distant echo of destruction.Slowly, David groaned and pushed himself up, coughing.The young man shakily raised his head, covered in dirt and food scraps.They both turned to look.Where the buffet had once stood was now a massive, smoking crater.Not a single trace of Eli.Nothing left but rubble.David stared in silence.Then, wiping debris off his shirt, he muttered flatly,“Yeah.

His head lolled back against the car, his eyelids drooping. But before David could figure out their next move, the distant wail of sirens pierced the air. WEE-OOO WEE-OOO WEE-OOO! David’s head snapped up, eyes widening as two police cars screeched into the parking lot, lights flashing. “Oh, come on!” David hissed under his breath. The cars skidded to a halt, blocking the exit. Two officers quickly stepped out, hands resting on their belts as they scanned the wreckage of the buffet. The taller officer spoke first, his tone firm. “We got a call about a serious disturbance. The manager reported—” Before he could finish, the buffet doors burst open. The manager, face red with fury, sprinted out, waving his arms frantically. “THAT’S HIM!” he screamed, pointing directly at Eli. “HE’S THE ONE WHO ATE EVERYTHING!” David froze. Eli’s eyes barely fluttered open, but David could feel him tense slightly. The officers turned sharply, their focus shifting to Eli. The taller officer narrowed his eyes. “Sir, care to explain?” David reacted first, throwing up his hands. “Wait, wait, you think he did this?” David laughed nervously, gesturing at Eli’s frail, slumped form. “Come on, look at him! Does he look like he could eat an entire restaurant?” The shorter officer squinted at Eli, then at the destruction behind them. Eli, barely conscious, mustered a weak, pitiful cough. “Oh… it was horrible…” Eli wheezed, clutching his flat stomach for effect. David jumped in. “Yeah! Some huge guy—massive belly, like nothing I’ve ever seen—just came in and started eating everything! Scared everyone off, and then a truck showed up, and the guy left!” The taller officer frowned. “A truck?” David nodded eagerly. “Yeah, big flatbed thing. The guy could barely move, so they had to haul him away. You can ask the staff! Well… whoever’s left.” The manager, still panting, tried to speak. “N-no! It was him! I saw him! That guy—” Eli suddenly gave a weak, dramatic groan. “Oh… I feel faint…” He leaned heavily against David, who caught him just in time. David glared at the manager. “Look at him. He can barely stand. You really think he did all this?” The shorter officer hesitated, glancing at Eli’s exhausted figure. The taller officer frowned, but the doubt was creeping in. “Do you have any proof it was him?” The manager stammered, glancing desperately toward the ruined building. “I— I— the cameras! The security footage!” David quickly cut in. “Oh, good idea! Go check those cameras. You’ll see the guy I told you about.” The taller officer sighed. “We’ll look into it. But right now, we don’t have anything to hold them on.” The manager’s face turned red. “But—” “Sir,” the officer cut him off. “We’ll handle this. You two are free to go for now.” David didn’t waste a second. “Thank you, officer. We’ll just… get out of your way.” He practically dragged Eli toward the car, fumbling with the door handle. As they got in, Eli gave a faint, smug chuckle. “See? Told you I’m not the only one who eats too much.” David shot him a look. “You owe me. Big time.” Eli slumped back in the seat, a satisfied grin creeping onto his face. David started the car, muttering, “Let’s get out of here before they actually check those cameras.” The engine roared to life, and they drove off, leaving flashing lights and a furious manager behind.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidFumbledWith.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Journey home",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.davidFumbledWith.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidAndEliSlipp"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidStruggledTo":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David struggled to keep Eli upright as they slowly made their way to the car.

No, no, you don’t need to—” But the officer had already turned away, speaking into his radio. “Dispatch, we need immediate access to the security cameras at King’s Buffet.” David’s stomach dropped. The officers waited in tense silence. Moments later, static crackled through the radio. “We’ve got the footage… Uh… you’re going to want to see this.” The taller officer turned back, his face darkening. “We’ve got you on camera. Eating. Everything.” David’s face paled. Eli blinked slowly, then gave a weak chuckle. “Guess I was hungry…” The officer’s hand moved to his cuffs. “Both of you, turn around. You’re under arrest for destruction of property and public endangerment.” David’s hands shot up. “Wait, what?! I didn’t eat anything!” The second officer grabbed David’s arm, yanking it behind his back. “Accessory to the crime. You were helping him.” Eli groaned as the taller officer struggled to cuff him, needing both hands to force his arms behind his massive frame. “Seriously?” Eli muttered. The officers shoved both of them toward the police car. “Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.” David was practically thrown into the backseat, glaring at Eli. “This is all your fault.” Eli slumped beside him, eyes half-closed. “…Can we stop for food on the way?” David stared at him in disbelief.

David sighed in relief. “Finally.” The driver slammed the gear into park, wiping his forehead. “Never again.” David hopped out of the cab and looked back at Eli. “Alright, big guy. Time to get off.” Eli let out a tired groan. The driver hesitated before lowering the battered hydraulic ramp. The platform creaked dangerously as it tilted down. Eli slowly, and with great effort, rolled off the truck bed. THUD. His massive belly slammed into the soft grass of David’s backyard. The impact caused the ground to tremble slightly, and without warning— CRASH! Eli’s bloated stomach rolled right into David’s small garden shed, flattening it instantly under the sheer weight. David blinked, staring at the splintered remains of the shed. “…That was expensive.” Eli groaned, too tired to care. “Comfy though.” David sighed. “Well, I guess this is your bed now.” Eli smirked, slowly closing his eyes. David smirked back. “Get some sleep. You’re going to need it.” Eli cracked one eye open. “Why?” David grinned. “Because tomorrow, I’ve got a surprise for you.” Eli chuckled softly, his breathing slowing as he began to drift off. David turned to the truck driver, who was staring in horror at his mangled flatbed. The frame was twisted, the tires ruined, and the platform hung limp and broken. The driver’s eyes welled up as he ran a shaky hand through his hair. “…I’m sending you the bill,” he muttered, voice cracking. David clapped him on the shoulder. “Yeah, yeah. Add it to my tab.” The driver climbed back into the cab, starting the engine with a painful groan from the vehicle. David turned back to Eli, who was already snoring softly, sprawled out in the ruins of the garden shed. David smirked. “Tomorrow’s going to be fun.” The night settled quietly around them as the broken truck sputtered away, leaving David and his sleeping, oversized friend behind.","\n","ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"fat_bufet_belly","re":true},["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theOverloadedFla.0.9.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^County Fair",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theOverloadedFla.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.9.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theParkingLotWas":[["^The parking lot was drowned in flashing red and blue lights as the police cars idled, casting long shadows over the wreckage of the buffet.

With alarming speed, Eli lunged forward, his massive hand snapping out to grab the closest officer. Before anyone could react— GLLLRRK! Eli shoved the officer into his mouth and swallowed him whole. \"OH MY GOD!\" one of the officers screamed, fumbling for his gun. \"HE JUST ATE HIM!\" Panic erupted. Eli lunged again, snatching the second officer and effortlessly swallowing him. The remaining officers turned to run, but Eli inhaled deeply— SSSSHHHH!

David rubbed his face. “I… I don’t even know what to say anymore.” Eli let out a deep, satisfied BURRRRP that echoed across the now-silent parking lot. The truck driver stumbled backward in horror. \"WHAT THE HELL, MAN?! I can’t move you now! The truck's ruined!\" David sighed, rubbing his forehead. “Then call for something bigger.” The driver, hands shaking, fumbled for his phone. “I-I know a guy… industrial haulers… something huge...” Minutes later, the ground began to tremble. A deep, rumbling VROOOOOM filled the air. A massive industrial tow truck, easily twice the size of the last one, rolled into the lot. Its reinforced hydraulic arm gleamed under the parking lights. David crossed his arms. “Well, that’s more like it.” The driver of the giant tow truck hopped out, staring at Eli in disbelief. “That’s him?” David deadpanned. “Yup. Good luck.” The massive hydraulic crane slowly extended and lowered toward Eli. The thick steel cables wrapped around Eli’s bloated belly. As the arm began to lift, Eli let out a surprised laugh. “Pfft! Hey! That tickles!” The crane groaned but held steady, slowly lifting Eli’s massive form off the ground. His belly jiggled as the crane struggled to balance him. David rolled his eyes. “Yeah, laugh it up. At least you’re moving.” Eli giggled, wobbling slightly as he was carefully loaded onto the reinforced flatbed. Once secured, the truck’s engine roared to life. David climbed into the cab beside the driver, glancing back at Eli, who sprawled across the bed, his stomach gurgling quietly. The industrial tow truck slowly rumbled out of the parking lot. David let out a long, tired sigh. “I swear, if you eat this truck too, I’m leaving you in a ditch.” Eli chuckled. “No promises.” And with that, they rolled off into the night.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theParkingLotWas.0.20.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Journey home",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theParkingLotWas.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.20.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theMassiveIndust"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theParkingLotWas1":[["^The parking lot was a mess of flashing red and blue lights, the air thick with tension.

A misunderstanding.” He turned to his radio. “This is Unit 45, requesting immediate assistance. Suspect is too large for standard transport. We need a heavy-duty vehicle, over.” David’s stomach dropped. “Wait, wait, you’re seriously calling for backup?” The officer shot him a cold glare. “Oh, we’re not letting this one walk away.” Minutes later, the ground began to rumble as the sound of a massive engine echoed through the air. A colossal police tow truck—custom-built for heavy-duty hauling—rolled into the lot. Reinforced steel, flashing lights, and a crane powerful enough to move tanks. David stared in disbelief. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.” The driver of the tow truck stepped out, adjusting his cap and surveying Eli with a professional detachment. “Which one’s the cargo?” The officer pointed directly at Eli. “That.” The driver paused, whistled low, and then nodded. “Alright. Let’s get him loaded up.” The crane extended with a mechanical WHIRR, lowering thick steel cables around Eli’s bloated form. David muttered under his breath, “This is so humiliating.” Eli groaned as the crane slowly lifted him off the ground. The steel groaned under the strain, but it held. Eli’s enormous belly swayed slightly as he was hoisted onto the massive flatbed. David shook his head, exasperated. The police double-checked the restraints, ensuring Eli was securely fastened. The lead officer approached David. “You’re both coming with us. Get in the squad car.” David threw his hands up. “Seriously? He’s already on the truck!” The officer didn’t flinch. “Now.” David grumbled and climbed into the backseat of the police cruiser. Eli let out a low, exhausted sigh as the giant tow truck’s engine rumbled to life. The convoy—flashing lights leading the way—slowly rolled out of the parking lot, the massive truck carrying Eli like cargo. The city streets blurred by as they made their way through traffic, people staring in shock at the sight. After a long, tense drive, the truck finally pulled into a secure parking lot behind the police station. The driver carefully maneuvered the massive vehicle into place, parking it with a hiss of brakes. The officer opened the cruiser door, yanking David out. “Welcome to your new home.” David glanced up at the imposing building, then back at Eli strapped to the flatbed. “…Fantastic.” The police station loomed in front of them, ready to process their most unusual suspects.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theParkingLotWas1.0.18.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^At the Station",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theParkingLotWas1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.18.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Policie"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theMassiveIndust":[["^The massive industrial truck rumbled down the dark suburban street, its reinforced suspension creaking under Eli's immense weight.

The truck driver gripped the wheel, his face pale and drenched in sweat. “This thing’s not supposed to haul living freight, man.” David smirked tiredly. “Yeah? Well, maybe you should advertise that next time.” The truck groaned as it turned onto David’s street, crawling up the driveway with agonizing slowness. With a final hiss of the brakes, the behemoth of a truck came to a stop in David’s backyard. The driver wiped his forehead, stepping out cautiously. “Alright. Let’s unload the beast.” The massive hydraulic crane slowly extended, its steel cables wrapping around Eli’s bloated form. As the crane began to lift, Eli let out another chuckle. “Pfft! Hey! That tickles again!” David rolled his eyes. “Oh, grow up.” The crane groaned but managed to swing Eli over the yard. THUD! Eli’s massive body dropped onto the grass, his enormous belly rolling forward and completely flattening David’s garden shed with a loud CRASH. David stared at the splintered remains of the shed. “…Really?” Eli let out a content sigh, sprawling across the lawn. “Perfect spot.” David sighed and turned to the driver. “So, how much do I owe you?” The driver, still staring at his battered and warped truck, gritted his teeth. “That’s gonna be five grand for the trip… plus another two for the damage.” David winced. “Oof.” The driver crossed his arms. “And don’t forget the ‘risking my life fee.’” David groaned, pulling out his wallet. “Fine. Whatever. Just take it.” He handed over a thick wad of cash. The driver snatched it without another word, climbed into his mangled truck, and slowly drove off, the engine sputtering in protest. David let out a long, exhausted breath and turned back toward the yard. “…Eli, don’t...” David’s eyes widened in disbelief. Eli was gripping a small tree, yanking it straight out of the ground with a loud CRACK. “Eli!” David snapped. But Eli just tilted his head back and shoved the entire tree into his mouth, munching loudly. “MMMPH!” CRUNCH. CRACK. David slapped his forehead. “Seriously?! That was expensive landscaping!” Eli swallowed with a satisfied sigh. “Tasted expensive, too.” David groaned and waved him off. “Alright, whatever. Just stay out here and don’t eat the house.” Eli chuckled, settling deeper into the flattened remains of the shed. David turned to go inside but paused at the door. “Oh, and Eli?” Eli lazily opened one eye. “Yeah?” David smirked. “Get some sleep. I’ve got a surprise for you tomorrow.” Eli grinned, closing his eyes. “Better be food.” David laughed softly, stepping inside. “Wouldn’t dream of anything else.” The night settled in, with Eli softly snoring in the yard, half-buried in his own destruction, while David finally got a moment of peace—though not for long.","\n","ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"fat_bufet_belly","re":true},["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theMassiveIndust.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Next Morning",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.theMassiveIndust.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"Police":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The squad car pulled up to the police station, its tires crunching against the gravel. The cold glow of the building’s exterior lights bathed the scene in a harsh white glare. The officers opened the back door, and Eli slowly stepped out, his oversized clothes hanging limply from his deflated frame. He looked small, fragile—even harmless. David climbed out of the passenger seat of another car, his hands shoved deep into his jacket pockets. He watched nervously as the officers led Eli up the concrete steps. One of the officers threw David a sharp glance. \"You wait here,\" the officer barked, jerking his thumb toward the hard plastic chairs lining the hallway inside. David nodded silently, dropping into one of the chairs. His foot began bouncing anxiously as he watched Eli disappear behind a heavy metal door. The station was cold and sterile. The buzz of fluorescent lights hummed above. David could hear distant phones ringing, quiet murmurs from officers, and the occasional shuffle of papers. Every sound made his nerves tighten. Eli was guided down a long, empty hallway. His footsteps echoed unnervingly off the whitewashed walls. His throat tightened. His stomach, nearly empty now, gave a quiet groan that he prayed no one noticed. They reached a metal door with a small, fogged window. One of the officers yanked it open. \"Sit,\" the older detective ordered, his tone sharp. Eli slipped into the cold metal chair, folding in on himself. The room was small, the air stale. A bare lightbulb swung slightly overhead, casting hard shadows across the table. Across from him sat two detectives. The older one had a stone-cold face, deep lines carved around his mouth. The younger one leaned against the wall, arms crossed, eyes locked on Eli. The older detective spoke first, his voice slow and heavy. \"Start talking.\" Eli blinked, confused. \"About what?\" The detective’s eyes narrowed. \"Witnesses say you devoured enough food to shut down an entire buffet. Piles of it. And you were growing. Ballooning right there in front of everyone. Now, you’re sitting here like nothing happened.\" He leaned in, his voice darkening. \"Explain.\" Eli gave a weak chuckle. \"I-I was just hungry?\" The younger detective pushed off the wall, stepping closer. \"Hungry?\" he snapped. \"That’s the best you’ve got? You expect us to believe that?\" Eli opened his mouth, but nothing came out. The older detective’s lip curled. \"No one eats that much. And no one shrinks back to normal like flipping a switch. So, how’d you do it?\" \"I-I guess I digest fast?\" Eli mumbled, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I don’t know. I just... can’t stop when I start eating.\" GGRRRROOOOAAAN. The sound ripped through the air, wet and deep. Eli’s face burned red as his stomach gurgled violently. He wrapped his arms around his middle, squeezing as if he could shut it up. The younger detective laughed dryly. \"Still hungry? After eating half the city?\" Eli gave a nervous smile. \"Guess so...\" The older detective wasn’t amused. He slammed his hand on the metal table, the noise cracking through the room like a gunshot. Eli flinched hard. \"Enough games! People are scared. Property’s damaged. You could’ve hurt someone. So how did you do it?\" Eli’s breathing quickened. His stomach let out another loud, bubbling growl. His eyes darted between them. \"I—I’m sorry, okay?! I didn’t mean to cause any trouble!\" His voice cracked. \"I just… I’m really thirsty. Could I... maybe get some water? From the fountain outside?\" The older detective froze, staring at him with cold eyes. \"Water?\" he repeated slowly. Eli nodded quickly. \"Y-yeah. Just a drink, please.\" The younger detective narrowed his eyes, glancing at his partner. Neither of them moved. The room seemed to shrink, the walls pressing in.

The hallway was cold and quiet, each step echoing in the stillness. David glanced up from the bench as they passed, his eyes flicking between Eli and the officer trailing him. Eli offered a weak, apologetic smile. They stopped in front of the drinking fountain at the end of the hall. Eli leaned down and pressed the button, letting the cool stream of water trickle into his mouth. He drank. And drank. And drank. The officer leaned against the wall, arms crossed, watching with growing annoyance. \"Alright, that’s enough. Let’s go.\" But Eli didn’t stop. The trickle of water kept flowing into his mouth, and slowly, ever so slowly, his stomach began to push forward, rounding out beneath his oversized shirt. The officer’s brow furrowed. \"Hey! I said that’s enough!\" He grabbed Eli’s shoulder and yanked, but Eli didn’t budge. His hands clung to the sides of the fountain, fingers gripping the metal with surprising strength. \"What the—\" The officer pulled harder. \"Let go!\" But Eli’s belly continued to swell, stretching outward, his shirt riding up to reveal the skin underneath. His stomach groaned as it expanded, round and taut. \"Dammit!\" The officer let go, panic creeping into his voice. He turned on his heel and bolted back toward the interrogation room. \"HEY! I need backup!\" Eli’s eyes, wide with panic and hunger, darted around. His lips tightened, and without thinking, he lunged forward and bit clean through the thin metal spout of the fountain. The broken pipe hissed, and a powerful jet of water gushed straight into his mouth. The effect was immediate. Eli’s belly ballooned outward, swelling rapidly. His skin stretched tight, groaning under the pressure as water pumped into him with unstoppable force. Footsteps thundered back down the hallway. The younger officer returned with the older detective at his heels. \"What the hell is going on?!\" the older detective barked. \"There’s something wrong with him!\" the younger officer shouted, pointing at Eli. Both officers rushed forward, grabbing Eli’s arms, trying to yank him away, but Eli’s bloated body barely budged. His stomach now filled most of the hallway, rounding out like an enormous, water-filled balloon. His limbs were almost engulfed by his own swelling torso. \"Pull harder!\" the older detective roared. But no matter how hard they pulled, Eli was stuck. The water roared into him, and his belly expanded even faster, pressing hard against the walls. The hallway creaked ominously. The officer who had been watching David finally bolted toward them. \"What the hell’s happening?!\" \"Help us get him off!\" the older detective snapped. But it was too late. Eli's stomach surged forward, slamming into the three officers and pinning them against the walls. The fleshy, water-filled mass expanded relentlessly, sealing them in. David’s eyes widened in horror. The officers’ shouts were muffled by the soft, groaning stretch of Eli’s belly pressing tighter. David didn’t hesitate. He sprinted down the hall, dodging the bulging mass that had swallowed the corridor. Behind him, he heard the muffled screams and the wet creaks of Eli’s belly straining against the walls. Then—CRACK. The sound echoed through the station like thunder. David’s heart pounded as he burst through the station doors and into the cold night air. He stopped in the middle of the empty street, chest heaving, staring back at the entrance. The building groaned behind him. Shouts echoed inside, followed by deep, ominous rumbling.

Eli glanced down at his now heavily distended stomach, watching it lurch as the detectives squirmed faintly inside. \"...Better.\" Without hesitation, Eli barreled through the door, the metal slamming open with a violent CRASH.

His stomach pushed even further outward, rounding like a massive overfilled balloon, sloshing and groaning. David shot to his feet, eyes wide in disbelief.

David burst through the station doors, lungs burning, and stumbled onto the cold pavement. He turned back toward the building, chest heaving. Through the glass, he could see it—Eli’s enormous, heaving belly pressing against the windows. The distorted silhouettes of people still struggling inside bulged faintly beneath the stretched skin. Eli shifted slightly, and the massive dome of his stomach quivered, sloshing heavily. David swallowed hard, wiped sweat from his brow, and let out a shaky breath. \"...Yeah.

The drywall groaned, fractures spiderwebbing along the ceiling. One officer inched closer, hand shaking. \"Is... is that even human?\" CRRRAAACK. The walls buckled. A deep, sickening groan vibrated through the building as the structure began to give way. Then, in one horrifying moment, the walls snapped.

Officers and staff screamed as they were caught in the unstoppable avalanche, bodies crushed beneath the relentless expansion. BOOM! Room after room was devoured, the force of Eli’s swelling body splintering the station’s foundation. Filing cabinets crumpled like paper. Doors ripped off their hinges.

It filled every window, pushing against the fragile panes. Floor after floor, window after window, the same sight: Eli’s massive belly consuming every inch of space inside. The entire station seemed to freeze. Time itself felt suspended. David watched, his heart pounding in his chest. Then— BOOOOOM!!! The police station exploded outward in a shower of bricks, steel, and shattered glass. Walls disintegrated, the roof lifted off like paper. Debris rained down in every direction. And from the heart of the destruction, Eli’s enormous, bloated form surged free, finally unbound. His belly, now unimaginably vast, quivered slightly in the air. Perched atop it, Eli sat cheerfully, his legs dangling over the edge. He raised a hand and waved enthusiastically down at David. \"Heyyy, David!\" Eli’s voice boomed, echoing through the empty streets, innocent and joyful. David stared, mouth slightly open, as bits of debris clattered around him. \"...Oh, God,\" he whispered. The ground was littered with rubble, the air thick with dust. Behind Eli, the ruins of the police station smoldered, barely recognizable. David didn’t move. He couldn’t. He just stood there, staring up at the impossibly huge figure of his friend, waiting to see what could possibly happen next.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Police.insideTheStation.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Journey home",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Police.insideTheStation.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Police.eliStoodAmongThe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"insideThePoliceS":["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Inside the police station, panic reached its peak. Eli’s bloated belly had swollen beyond imagination, pressing into walls, ceilings, and doorframes. The groans of straining metal and cracking concrete filled the air as his body expanded relentlessly, consuming every inch of space. Officers pounded on locked doors, others scrambled over desks, desperate to escape the crushing pressure. \"Move! MOVE!\" someone screamed, but there was nowhere left to go. The building creaked, sagging under the impossible weight. Eli’s skin, stretched impossibly thin, shimmered under the harsh fluorescent lights. Veins pulsed, and hairline fractures crawled across his taut skin, spraying thin jets of water. GRRROOOAAAAN. The walls began to bow outward. David, standing frozen on the sidewalk, watched in stunned silence. Through every window, all he could see was a pale, bloated mass pressing against the glass, bulging outward like an overfilled balloon. The ground vibrated. The building groaned, seeming to take one last breath. And then— BOOOOOOOM! Eli’s belly detonated with a sickening, thunderous explosion. A catastrophic wave of water erupted from every shattered window and crumbling wall. The station burst apart like paper soaked in rain. Water exploded into the street in a violent surge, obliterating everything in its path. Cars were lifted and tossed like toys, streetlights snapped, and the shockwave of the blast rattled buildings for blocks. David barely had time to dive behind a parked car as the flood roared past him, slamming into storefronts and sweeping debris down the road. When the flood finally slowed, the street was left in ruin. David slowly peeked out from behind the car, drenched and dripping, staring at the collapsed husk of the police station. Water trickled through the rubble. There was nothing left. No sign of Eli. No movement. David blinked, coughing as he pushed soggy hair out of his face. He let out a long breath and muttered under his breath, deadpan, \"...Yeah. That went well.\"","\n","^<strong>\"Note to self: Police stations weren’t built to hold human water balloons.

Panicked screams echoed through the halls, blending with the deep, guttural GULPS that rattled the very walls. Eli moved methodically, his bloated form wobbling and sloshing with every heavy step. His stomach had grown to an enormous size, stretching far ahead of him, rounding out like a massive, overinflated balloon. THOOM. THOOM. Each step shook the ground as Eli advanced, devouring every officer and staff member in his path. \"SOMEBODY STOP HIM!\" \"HE'S—AGH!\" GLOOORP! Another officer vanished into his gaping maw. Eli’s belly lurched forward, swelling even larger, the skin tight and glistening under the flickering fluorescent lights. Faint impressions of hands and limbs occasionally pressed against the stretched flesh before sinking back into the soft mass. Desks, chairs, and walls crumbled as Eli lumbered through the corridors, his enormous belly shoving aside everything in his way. Finally, there was no one left. The station was eerily quiet, save for the wet, ominous gurgles echoing from Eli's belly. He turned toward the entrance, his massive form barely fitting through the shattered hallways. With a deep breath, Eli lunged forward. CRAAAAAASH! The front doors exploded outward, glass and metal flying as Eli’s enormous stomach barreled through, knocking aside the heavy frame like it was paper. He staggered into the cold night air, the ground trembling beneath his weight. David, standing on the sidewalk across the street, could only stare in disbelief. Eli's stomach was monstrous—round, bloated beyond belief, stretching out in front of him like a giant, wobbling dome. The surface shifted and bulged unnaturally, faint movements beneath the stretched skin hinting at the dozens of people trapped inside. Eli wiped sweat from his brow, panting heavily. David blinked, taking a step back and raising his hands in mock surrender. \"Okay,\" David said slowly, eyeing the massive, quivering belly. \"I... I think you might have overdone it.\" Eli let out a small, sheepish burp, his entire stomach wobbling violently. BWWUUUURP! David flinched. \"Yeah, definitely overdid it.\" Eli giggled breathlessly, giving his enormous belly a slow, rhythmic pat that sent ripples across its surface. \"It’s not my fault,\" Eli huffed. \"They wouldn’t let me get water.\" David stared for a long, silent moment, then sighed, shaking his head. \"Man, remind me to never argue with you when you're hungry.\" Eli grinned, still catching his breath. David looked past him at the destroyed building, the broken entrance, and the faint sounds of muffled groans and shifting from within Eli's stomach. \"...So,\" David muttered, hands on his hips. \"What now? You gonna roll home or what?\" Eli’s belly gave another loud gurgle, making David instinctively take a step back. Eli smirked. \"I dunno. Got any better ideas?\" David chuckled nervously. \"Yeah.

The round, taut orb of his stomach stretched far in front of him, wobbling gently with every breath. His shirt was bunched up high on his chest, completely overwhelmed by the sheer size of his gut. David stood a few feet away, arms crossed, staring at him with tired eyes. \"You know,\" David muttered, motioning vaguely to Eli’s enormous belly, \"it’d be really great if you could shrink back down so we can actually go home.\" Eli pouted, resting both hands lovingly on the sides of his bloated stomach. He rubbed slow, affectionate circles over its stretched surface, which let out a deep, satisfied groooan. \"But it’s so perfect like this,\" Eli whined softly, giving it a few more tender pats. \"So big and round and... cozy.\" David’s expression didn’t change. \"Yeah, well, unless that thing comes with wheels, we’re walking home. So how about we deal with it now?\" Eli sighed dramatically, as if David had just asked him to give up a beloved pet. \"Goodbye, my beautiful belly,\" he murmured, giving it one last, affectionate rub. Reluctantly, Eli closed his eyes and focused. A deep, bubbling grrrrmmmmbll echoed from within him. His belly suddenly began to shrink, wobbling slightly as it contracted. The round mass steadily pulled inward, the tight skin softening and deflating like a balloon. GRRROOOOOLL... Eli let out a small groan as the process quickened, and within seconds, he was back to his slim, normal frame. His shirt sagged loosely over his now-flat stomach. \"Hooooh...\" Eli exhaled, wiping sweat from his brow. David blinked slowly. \"Better.\" Eli rubbed his empty belly with a soft whimper. \"I already miss it…\" David rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, well, maybe next time don’t eat an entire police station.\" Eli gave a tired chuckle. \"No promises.\" David jerked his head toward the street. \"Come on. The car’s still at the buffet, so we’re walking.\" Eli groaned. \"Ugh, seriously?!\" David was already walking. \"Yup. Let’s go.\" Eli trudged after him, dragging his feet. \"This is gonna take forever...\" David smirked over his shoulder. \"Good. You could use the exercise.\"By the time they finally reached home, both of them were exhausted. David fumbled with his keys, unlocking the front door as Eli slouched against the frame, barely keeping his eyes open. Inside, the house was quiet and still. David tossed his keys onto the counter and slumped onto the couch with a heavy sigh. Eli flopped face-first onto the armchair, groaning loudly. David peeked over at him. \"So… feeling better now?\" Eli mumbled into the cushion. \"Mmm… maybe. Still kinda hungry.\" David let out a dry laugh. \"Figures.\" He leaned back and stretched. \"Oh, by the way, I’ve got something planned for you tomorrow.\" Eli turned his head slightly. \"Oh? What is it?\" David smirked. \"Not telling. But maybe... take it easy in the morning, alright?\" Eli lifted his head. \"Aw, come on, give me a hint!\" \"Nope. It’s a surprise.\" David yawned and pushed himself off the couch. \"Now go to bed. We’ve got a big day ahead.\" Eli groaned but slowly got up. \"Fine, but this better be worth it.\" David chuckled as he flicked off the lights. \"Oh, trust me,\" he muttered, heading down the hall, \"it’ll be unforgettable.\" And with that, the house fell into peaceful silence as they both finally got some much-needed rest.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Police.eliStoodAmongThe.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^County Fair",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Police.eliStoodAmongThe.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.theSoftMorningLi1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"Policie":[["ev",{"VAR?":"police_transport"},"!","/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The battered flatbed truck groaned under Eli’s enormous weight as it crawled through the quiet, dark streets.

From the back, Eli let out a low, content groan. “Just… hurry up. I need sleep.” The truck driver gripped the steering wheel tightly, his eyes locked on the road. “Yeah, yeah. I’m trying. This thing isn’t exactly built for moving a mountain.” But before they could make it any further, red and blue lights suddenly flared in the rearview mirror. WEE-OOO WEE-OOO WEE-OOO! David’s head snapped up. “Oh, great.” Two police cars sped up behind them, lights flashing. The truck driver cursed under his breath. “Aw, come on! What now?!” A voice barked through a loudspeaker. “PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY!” The driver sighed heavily and carefully guided the groaning truck to the side of the road. Two officers approached cautiously, hands resting on their weapons. The taller officer glared at the warped truck bed. “What the hell is going on here?” David leaned out of the window, forcing a smile. “Uh… food delivery?” The officer didn’t even blink. “Step out of the vehicle. All of you.” David sighed and climbed down, followed by the visibly trembling driver. Eli remained slumped on the back of the truck, barely conscious. One officer pointed at Eli. “What is that?” David raised his hands defensively. “Look, it’s not what it looks like. He just… had a lot to eat. We’re taking him home.” The officer narrowed his eyes. “We’ve had multiple reports of destruction of property. You’re both coming with us.” David’s eyes widened. “Oh, come on! Look, he’s barely awake! He’s harmless!” The officer didn’t budge. “You’ll explain it at the station. Follow us.” The driver groaned, slamming his hand against the steering wheel. “This is NOT my problem.” But he had no choice. With the police cars leading, the battered truck slowly rumbled back onto the road, moving sluggishly toward the police station.After a painfully slow drive, they arrived at the police station. The reinforced gates creaked open, and the truck crawled into the secure parking lot behind the building. The officers gestured for the driver to park near a clear, open space. “Unload him. Now.” The driver glared at David. “I swear, if I get arrested for this—” David raised his hands. “Just get it over with.” The driver sighed and lowered the battered hydraulic ramp. CLANK. CREEEAAAK. The steel groaned as Eli slowly slid down, his massive form settling heavily onto the pavement with a deep THUD. The ground trembled slightly. Eli let out a weak, annoyed groan. “Ugh… where are we?” David glanced around at the squad cars and armed officers. “Oh, just where every innocent person wants to be—jail.” The officers surrounded them, weapons lowered but ready. One officer radioed in, “Suspect is secured in the rear lot. Awaiting further instructions.” The driver slumped against his truck, staring at the twisted metal of the flatbed. “…I’m billing you for this,” he muttered, his voice flat. David groaned, rubbing his temples. “Yeah, yeah. Get in line.” The officers stood ready as Eli remained slumped on the pavement, his massive belly groaning quietly.

Now let’s get out of here.”Eli wobbled to his feet, wiping his mouth.David yanked at his handcuffs.“Oh, and for the record, you’re never eating in public again.”Eli chuckled weakly.“No promises.”Without another word, the two of them disappeared into the night, leaving behind an empty, lifeless police station—its walls hollow, its staff gone.Only silence remained. David let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. \"Okay. No cops, no problem.\"Eli grinned. \"See? Easy.\"David shot him a look. \"We walked here, genius. The car’s still at the buffet.\"Eli groaned loudly. \"Oh, come on!\"\"Yeah, well, maybe if you didn’t eat an entire police station, we wouldn’t be in this situation,\" David snapped, already starting down the street.Eli grumbled but followed. \"You could at least let me ride on your shoulders or something.\"\"Not happening.\"They walked for what felt like forever, the cool night air biting at them. David’s pace was steady, while Eli dragged his feet, grumbling under his breath about how unfair it was.Finally, after a long and quiet trek, they reached home.David unlocked the door, practically collapsing onto the couch the second they stepped inside. Eli stumbled in behind him, stretching and letting out a long groan.David peeked at him from the couch. \"So… feeling better?\"Eli rubbed his belly thoughtfully. \"Yeah. Empty again, though.\"David let out a tired chuckle. \"Figures.\"Then, with a sly grin, David sat up slightly. \"Oh, and by the way, I’ve got something planned for you tomorrow.\"Eli’s eyes lit up. \"Wait, really? What is it?\"David shook his head. \"Not telling. But maybe don’t eat everything for breakfast, alright?\"Eli pouted. \"Aw, come on! Just a hint!\"\"Nope. It’s a surprise.\"David yawned and stretched. \"Now go to bed. Big day tomorrow.\"Eli sighed dramatically but turned toward his room. \"Fine, but this better be good.\"David smirked to himself as he flicked off the lights.\"Oh, trust me,\" he muttered, \"it’s gonna be unforgettable.\"The house finally settled into a peaceful silence as they both drifted off to sleep.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Policie.thePoliceStation4.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^County Fair",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Policie.thePoliceStation4.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"County_Fair.theSoftMorningLi1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theChiefOfPolice":[["^The Chief of Police stepped forward, his face twisted in disgust. “This is ridiculous,” he muttered, marching up to Eli.  Without hesitation, he jabbed his finger into Eli’s enormous stomach.  *BOING.*  The surface rippled slightly, followed by a deep, unsettling *GRRRROOOOAAAN.*  The Chief scoffed and turned to the officers.  “Process this thing and get it off my property.”  But Eli’s eyes snapped open, glinting dangerously.  With terrifying speed, Eli’s hand shot out and *snatched* the Chief off the ground.  Before the Chief could scream, Eli lazily tossed him into the air—  Higher, higher—  And then, Eli leaned back and opened his massive mouth.  *THUMP.*  The Chief dropped straight in.  *GULP.*  Gone.  For a split second, the parking lot was dead silent.  Then chaos erupted.  “*HE ATE THE CHIEF!*”  “*RUN!*”  Officers and staff scrambled in every direction, knocking over chairs and dropping weapons in pure panic.  But Eli wasn’t done.  He inhaled deeply.  *SSSSSSSSHHHHHHHH!*  A monstrous vacuum tore through the air.  People screamed as they were *ripped* off their feet and sucked toward Eli’s gaping maw.  *WHOOSH!*  *GLLRRRK. GULP.*  Desks, chairs, weapons, and dozens of bodies vanished into Eli.  Some officers clung to cars and railings, but one by one, they were dragged away.  Eli’s stomach *swelled* rapidly, stretching in every direction, dark stretch marks tearing across his skin.  His belly wobbled and groaned as it ballooned outward, pressing against the pavement.  David slowly backed away, eyes wide but silent, watching as the station’s entire staff disappeared.  Eli's massive gut gurgled ominously as the last screams faded.  The parking lot was now completely empty.  Eli sagged forward, his stomach grotesquely overinflated and groaning loudly.  He let out a low, strained breath.  “...Too much…”  For a moment, the lot was silent, broken only by the sound of Eli’s labored breathing and the occasional wet *glorp* from his belly.  Eli’s face contorted in discomfort.  His hands slowly pressed against the sides of his overstuffed gut.  *GRRRROOOOOAN.*  His stomach shuddered, and then—  *FWOOOOOOSH!*  Eli’s entire body began rapidly *deflating*, air hissing and gurgling out as his enormous form shrank.  His belly sloshed and squelched as it compressed inward, his skin sagging before tightening back to his thin, lean frame.  Finally, Eli slumped forward, drenched in sweat, barely able to breathe.  David approached cautiously, rubbing his wrists where the handcuffs had been.  Eli glanced at him, too exhausted to speak.  With a tired grunt, Eli leaned over and lazily *bit through* David’s handcuffs.  *SNAP.*  David shook off the broken metal.  Without a word, Eli staggered to his feet, wobbling slightly.  The two of them slowly turned and walked away, disappearing into the night.  Behind them, the police station was *silent*—emptied of every soul, every sound, and every trace of life.

The distant sound of music and laughter floated through the air. Banners waved in the breeze, and the smell of fried food already seemed to reach them. The fairground buzzed with energy as David pulled the car into the dusty parking lot. The air was filled with the distant hum of music, laughter, and the mouthwatering scent of fried food drifting on the breeze. Colorful tents and food stalls stretched as far as they could see, and a large banner flapped overhead:\"<strong>COUNTY FAIR – FOOD, FUN, AND THE FAMOUS PIE-EATING CONTEST!</strong>\"David turned off the engine and leaned back in his seat, taking in the scene.\"Well, here we are,\" he said, smirking. \"The land of deep-fried everything and unlimited bad decisions.\"Eli practically exploded out of the car, his eyes wide with excitement.\"Ohhh, this is gonna be amazing!\" he shouted, already bouncing on his heels.David stepped out more casually, stretching his arms overhead.\"Alright, slow down, big guy,\" David chuckled. \"So, what’s the plan?

The smell of sweet fruit pies and buttery crusts filled the air, making Eli’s stomach grumble loudly. At the booth, a bored-looking volunteer glanced up. \"Pie-eating contest? Sign up here.\" David filled out the form as Eli practically vibrated with excitement. \"Name?\" the volunteer asked. \"Eli!\" he beamed. The volunteer gave him a quick look up and down—thin, lanky, and practically drowning in his loose hoodie—before shrugging and handing them a contestant badge. The contest area was already bustling with people gathering around a long table piled high with pies. The other contestants were lining up, sizing each other up. Most of them were large, middle-aged men, their bellies spilling over their belts. One of them, a towering man with an enormous gut that strained against his stained tank top, leaned back in his chair and let out a deep, rumbling laugh. \"Hey, kid!\" he bellowed, slapping his belly. \"You sure you’re in the right place? The lemonade stand is that way!\" The other contestants chuckled. Eli gave a small, polite smile, unfazed. Another man leaned over, smirking. \"Careful, kid. You might choke on a blueberry.\" But the massive man leaned in closer, grinning wickedly. \"Tell you what,\" he sneered, licking his lips. \"After I’m done with these pies, I’ll save you for dessert.\" David stiffened, glaring. \"Real classy, pal.\" Eli just giggled. \"Hope you like eating dust.\" A loudspeaker crackled to life. \"Alright, folks! It’s time for the Annual Pie-Eating Contest! Ten minutes on the clock! Whoever eats the most pies wins a $500 prize and a year’s worth of bragging rights!\" The crowd roared with excitement. The contestants were each seated in front of towering stacks of pies. Eli took his seat at the far end of the table, barely able to sit still. David stood in the crowd, arms crossed with a smug grin. \"On your marks... get set... GO!\" Eli exploded into action. Without hesitation, he grabbed the first pie with both hands and shoved it into his mouth. Crust and filling vanished as he inhaled it in seconds. GULP. Gone. Another pie. GULP. And another. GULP. The crowd gasped, then erupted into cheers. The other contestants froze, mid-bite, staring in shock. \"Wh-what the hell?!\" one of them sputtered. Even the massive man who had taunted Eli paused, pie halfway to his mouth. Eli didn’t notice. He was already five pies in, barely slowing down. The volunteer staff scrambled, barely managing to keep Eli’s stack full. \"Get more pies! We’re running out!\" one of them shouted. The audience was going wild, chanting his name. \"ELI! ELI! ELI!\" Eli’s hands were a blur, his cheeks puffed out as he devoured pie after pie. Filling smeared his face, crust crumbs dusted his hoodie, but he didn’t stop. The big man next to him was still struggling through his third pie, sweat pouring down his face. \"Th-this... this is insane!\" he muttered, staring in disbelief. Minutes passed in a blur of cheering and frantic pie stacking. \"Ten seconds left!\" the announcer shouted. Eli shoved another pie into his mouth. \"Three... two... one... TIME!\" The horn blared. Eli sat back, letting out a small, satisfied sigh. The judges scrambled to count the empty pie tins. \"Thirty-six pies!\" one judge shouted in disbelief. The crowd erupted. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve, grinning wide. David let out a low whistle, clapping slowly. The enormous man who had taunted him slumped in his chair, staring at Eli in shock.

They weaved through the crowded pathways, passing colorful tents and carts stacked high with every kind of fair food imaginable. The air was thick with the sweet and savory scents of fried dough, grilled meats, and melted sugar. Eli came to a sudden stop between two bustling food stands. On one side, a brightly lit sweets stand offered mountains of funnel cakes dusted with powdered sugar, massive elephant ears dripping with glaze, and deep-fried candy bars. On the other side, the warm, savory scent of sizzling meat drifted from a stand overflowing with corn dogs, the golden batter crisp and perfect, with skewers stacked high and fresh batches dropping into bubbling oil.

Eli didn’t wait. SLUUURP. CHOMP. One after another, the baked goods disappeared. \"Faster,\" Eli snapped, licking caramel from his fingers. \"You’re falling behind.\" The workers gritted their teeth, furiously pulling more batter into the fryer, but Eli wasn’t slowing down. \"MORE,\" Eli barked. \"I’m still hungry!\" \"Dude, how are you not full?!\" the flour-stained worker hissed, sweat dripping down his face. \"He’s just messing with us,\" the guy in the cap muttered. \"*There’s no way he can eat everything.\" But Eli’s hands were a blur, funnel cakes and fried dough vanishing into his endless appetite.

The workers exhaled in relief. \"Finally,\" one mumbled, wiping sweat from his brow. \"We’re out.\" Eli tilted his head, eyeing the empty counter. Then, slowly, his eyes drifted past them—to the back of the stand. To the sacks of flour. The crates of sugar. The tubs of batter. Eli grinned. \"No,\" the cap-wearing worker whispered. \"Don’t you dare—\" But it was too late. Eli vaulted over the counter. \"HEY!\" \"STOP!\" David didn’t even flinch. He crossed his arms and sighed. \"Yeah,\" he muttered, \"saw that coming.\" Inside the stand, chaos erupted. CRRUNCH! SLORRRP! MMMPH! Bags of flour burst in clouds of white as Eli tore through the supplies. Crates of sugar, raw dough, sticks of butter—all gone. The stand rattled violently as Eli’s massive, swelling belly began to shove into shelves, knocking over mixing bowls and batter tubs. The two workers could only watch in horror. \"Everything’s gone...\" the flour-covered one whispered. Minutes later, Eli casually waddled back around the counter, his belly now bloated and heavy, wobbling with every step. He gave his distended stomach a slow, satisfied rub. \"Now I’m ready for more tummy stretching,\" Eli chuckled. David stared at him, deadpan. \"You are calling this thing a tummy?\" Eli grinned. \"So, what’s next? Corn dogs or pizza?\" David groaned.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theSweetHeavySce.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Corn dogs",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theSweetHeavySce.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Pizza stall",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theSweetHeavySce.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliAndDavidStrol"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theSweetHeavySce.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theMouthwatering"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theAirAroundTheC":[["^The air around the corn dog stand was thick with the mouthwatering scent of sizzling batter and grilled sausages. The golden glow of freshly fried corn dogs stacked high on the counter practically shimmered in the warm light. Eli’s stomach gave a loud, eager GRRROOOOAN as he rubbed his flat belly, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. \"I should probably warm up before the contest,\" Eli said, his eyes gleaming. David groaned beside him. \"You and your warm-ups.\" Eli’s attention was already locked onto the stand ahead. Behind the counter, two young women worked quickly. One, with a blonde ponytail, cheerfully handed out orders, while the other, wearing a backward cap, flipped corn dogs in the fryer. Eli sauntered up to the counter, leaning forward casually. \"Hey,\" Eli called, flashing a playful smile. \"I’ll take… fifty corn dogs.\" The girl in the cap blinked, then burst into laughter. \"Fifty?\" Her friend leaned on the counter, smirking. \"You sure about that, skinny?\" Eli grinned, patting his stomach. \"Tell you what,\" he leaned in closer, \"if I eat all fifty, I get to eat whatever I want from your stand for free.\" The girls exchanged a look, then shrugged and laughed. \"Deal,\" the ponytail girl said. \"But don’t expect a refund when you tap out.\" David sighed behind Eli, muttering, \"They never learn.\" Minutes later, the counter was stacked with trays piled high with crispy, golden corn dogs. A few fairgoers began to gather, curious about the commotion. Eli flexed his fingers, grinning. \"Ready?\" the girl in the cap teased. Without a word, Eli grabbed the first corn dog and— CRRUNCH! SLUUURP! It disappeared in seconds, stick and all. \"Wait—did he just eat the stick?\" the ponytail girl whispered. CHOMP! GULP! Another one gone. The crowd murmured in disbelief. By the tenth, the smirks on the girls' faces had started to fade. By the thirtieth, they were frantically frying more corn dogs, eyes wide with panic. \"How is he still going?!\" the girl in the cap hissed, sweat forming on her brow. \"Just keep frying!\" her friend snapped, shoving more battered dogs into the oil. Eli didn’t slow down. CRUNCH! GLOOORRRP! The wooden sticks snapped and slid down his throat with each bite. \"FORTY-SEVEN!\" \"FORTY-EIGHT!\" \"FORTY-NINE!\" Eli casually picked up the last corn dog, twirling it between his fingers. The girls leaned forward, holding their breath. Eli gave them a wink. CHOMP! SLUUUURRP! \"FIFTY!\" The small crowd that had gathered erupted in cheers. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, letting out a satisfied sigh. He leaned casually on the counter, smirking. \"Well?\" he teased. \"A deal’s a deal.\" The two girls stared at him, pale and sweating. \"Start handing it over,\" Eli added, licking his lips. The ponytail girl gritted her teeth and slid more trays forward. But Eli was just getting started. CRRUNCH. GLOOORP. He devoured tray after tray, the girls scrambling to fry more corn dogs to keep up. \"Hurry up!\" the girl in the cap hissed, flipping more batter into the oil. \"He’s still going!\" \"We can’t fry them fast enough!\" Eli leaned over the counter, grinning. \"Come on,\" he taunted. \"This all you’ve got?\" They were running out of steam. The stand was nearly empty. Eli sighed, feigning boredom. \"You know what?\" Before they could react, Eli vaulted over the counter. \"HEY!\" \"NO, NO, NO!\" David rubbed his face, shaking his head. \"Why does this keep happening?\" Inside the stand, Eli tore into the storage shelves. CRRUNCH! SLUURRRP! He devoured crates of raw hot dogs, barrels of cornmeal batter, entire jugs of frying oil. \"HE’S EATING THE INGREDIENTS!\" the ponytail girl shrieked. \"AND THE OIL!\" Eli grabbed a metal bucket of oil and gulped it down like water. GLUUUURRRP! Moments later, the stand was empty. Not a single corn dog. No batter. No oil. The girls slumped behind the counter, staring in disbelief. Eli waddled out, his belly now visibly heavier, swaying with each step. He gave his stretched stomach a slow, contented rub. \"Perfect.\" David stared at him, deadpan. \"You done yet?\" Eli grinned, scanning the fair. He noted the large pizza stall and stall with sweets.

His eyes narrowed as he spotted the massive man from the contest—the one who had mocked him earlier—wandering off behind the tent, casually lighting a cigarette.A sly grin crept across Eli’s face.\"Actually…\" Eli muttered, pushing himself up with a grunt. \"I gotta take care of something first.

The seams strained for a split second before the fabric ripped wide open, splitting up the sides. His bloated, heavy belly burst free, the pale, stretched skin glistening in the dim light.The surface shifted slightly, something inside pushing outward before slowly settling.Eli gave his bare, round belly a slow, affectionate rub.\"Told you I’m still hungry,\" he muttered, a wicked grin curling on his lips.---A few minutes later, Eli waddled casually back toward David, his bare, swollen stomach bouncing with each step.David, waiting near the contest tent, blinked in shock.\"Whoa.

The scent of sizzling batter and juicy sausages filled the air. Behind the counter, two young women worked the fryer. One of them, a brunette with a ponytail, was flipping corn dogs in the oil while her blonde friend handled the customers, laughing and chatting. Eli narrowed his eyes, thoughtfully patting his belly. David caught his expression. \"Oh no. What are you thinking?\" Eli smirked. \"I can’t exactly pull off the whole 'skinny guy challenge' routine with this thing,\" he said, giving his massive belly a pat. \"But… I have an idea. You’re gonna need to help me out.\" David sighed but cracked his neck, a grin creeping across his face. \"Fine. Let’s have some fun.\" Eli slipped quietly behind the stand, vanishing into the shadows. David casually approached the counter, flashing a confident, easygoing smile. \"Hey there,\" he said smoothly, his voice low and inviting. The blonde girl glanced up—and froze. Her eyes flicked from David’s broad shoulders to the way his shirt stretched across his chest. \"Oh, uh, hey!\" she stammered, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. David leaned in just slightly. \"Busy night?\" he asked, glancing at the fryer. She giggled nervously. \"Yeah, pretty crazy. But, y’know, fun.\" David smiled, glancing over his shoulder, then back at her. \"Listen… you’ve been working hard. How about you take a little break? Maybe come chat with me for a minute?\" She hesitated, biting her lip. \"I—uh… well, I guess my friend can handle it for a bit.\" David leaned in a little closer. \"Come on, just a few minutes.\" Her hesitation melted. \"Okay, but just for a second.\" David gestured casually behind the stand. \"Right this way.\" She followed him without a second thought, disappearing behind the stall. Moments later— GLLLUUUUUUUURRRP! A deep, wet gulp echoed faintly from behind the stand. David casually strolled back to the counter where the brunette was still frying corn dogs, unaware. \"Hey, uh… your friend might’ve twisted her ankle back there,\" David said, pointing behind the stand. The brunette’s head shot up. \"What?\" David nodded. \"Yeah, she’s sitting down, says it really hurts. Maybe you should check on her.\" Concern flickered in the girl’s eyes. \"Oh my God!\" she gasped, quickly setting the tongs aside. Without another word, she rushed toward the back. Seconds later— GLLLOOOORRRP! Another heavy gulp. David exhaled slowly, glancing over his shoulder. Moments later, Eli emerged from behind the stand, his belly now even larger, visibly shifting as something—or someone—moved inside. Eli gave his wobbling gut a satisfied pat, smirking. \"Mmm… needed that.\" David chuckled. \"Well,\" David nodded at the now unattended stand, \"time to finish the job.\" Without hesitation, Eli leaned over the counter and plowed into the trays of fresh corn dogs. CRRUNCH! SLUUURRRP! He grabbed entire skewers and shoved them into his mouth, sticks and all. Grease dripped from his chin as the golden batter crunched between his teeth. Tray after tray disappeared. Not satisfied, Eli vaulted over the counter and tore into the supplies in the back—raw sausages, batter, oil, everything. GLOOOOORRRP! Moments later, the stand was completely empty. Eli slowly waddled back around the front, his belly now dragging low, straining with the weight of his feast.

David, close behind, grinned when he spotted the sign. \"Oh, man. That’s calling your name!\" Eli rubbed his belly and smirked. \"Let’s make this interesting.\" They approached the counter where a scruffy man in a grease-stained apron was tossing dough. He looked up as Eli leaned forward, his belly pushing against the counter. \"So… if I eat one of those, it’s free?\" Eli asked casually. The man chuckled when he glanced at Eli’s already round gut. \"Yeah, but I don’t think you’re walking away with a free pizza today. You look like you’ve already stuffed yourself half to death.\" Eli just grinned. \"And what if I eat two? Do I get both free?\" The man smirked, raising an eyebrow. \"Sure, kid. Knock yourself out. But you won’t even finish one.\" David laughed, giving Eli an encouraging pat on the back. \"Easy money, man. Show him how it’s done.\" \"HEY! GET TWO OF THE BIG ONES GOING!\" the man shouted into the back. Minutes later, two massive, three-foot pizzas were wheeled out, steam rising from the gooey cheese and thick toppings. A small crowd began to gather, intrigued by the challenge. Eli cracked his knuckles and grinned. \"Let’s do this.\" Without hesitation, Eli grabbed half of the first pizza and rolled it up like a giant burrito. The vendor’s smirk faltered. \"Wait, what are you—\" CRRRUNCH! SLUUUURP! Eli shoved the rolled pizza into his mouth, tearing into it in massive bites. Cheese and sauce dripped down his chin as the doughy roll vanished. David chuckled, leaning on the counter. \"Man, you don’t waste time!\" The man behind the stand leaned forward, blinking in disbelief. \"No way…\" The first pizza was gone in under five minutes. Eli licked his lips and dove into the second. Halfway through, he called out between bites, his mouth still full. \"You... better... start making more!\" The man scowled. \"Hey! That’s not how this works! I’m not running a charity here!\" Eli’s eyes narrowed, and he gave his belly a slow, deliberate pat. \"Unless you want me to eat your whole stand,\" Eli said with a cold grin, \"you should get moving.\" The man paled, then snapped over his shoulder. \"FIRE UP MORE DOUGH!\" And so, the pizzas kept coming. Third. Fourth. By the fifth, sweat was pouring down the vendor’s face as he scrambled to keep up. \"How the hell is he still eating?!\" David laughed. \"He’s just getting started!\" The eighth pizza was devoured. The ninth disappeared in massive, sloppy gulps. When Eli reached the tenth, his belly groaned and bulged, stretching far out in front of him. Then— The loudspeaker crackled to life. \"ATTENTION FAIRGOERS! THE PIE-EATING CONTEST WILL BEGIN IN 15 MINUTES!\" David’s head shot up. \"Eli! That’s your event!\" Eli froze mid-bite, staring at the remaining pizza. His face twisted into a pout. \"But...\" he whined, glancing at the stack of freshly baked pizzas. David grinned. \"Come on, man. Time to win another prize!\" Eli grumbled but didn’t leave just yet. He finished the tenth pizza in two massive bites. Then, without breaking eye contact with the stunned vendor, Eli leaned forward, wrapped his arms around the stack of fresh pizzas waiting to be served, and in one massive GLOOORRRP, swallowed the entire stack whole. The crowd gasped. David burst out laughing. \"Okay, now we can go.\" Eli wiped his mouth and gave his bloated belly a satisfied pat. \"Fine,\" Eli mumbled, turning to waddle toward the contest tent, his stomach bouncing heavily with each step.

Strings of raw sausages slid past his lips like noodles.David winced from the sidelines.\"Oh, come on, Eli… that’s still raw!\"But Eli didn’t care. His belly bulged outward even more, groaning loudly under the pressure. The seams of his ruined hoodie gave one final, pathetic rrriiippp, and his belly spilled fully into the open, wobbling heavily with every movement.The grill master stared in shock, face pale.\"Who’s gonna PAY for all this?!\" he screamed, his voice cracking.Eli paused, a massive rack of ribs halfway into his mouth.

Beside her, a younger assistant was stacking loaves of bread, chatting cheerfully with customers.Eli’s eyes lit up.\"Sweet,\" he purred, rubbing his exposed, swollen belly.David groaned. \"You’ve got to be kidding me.

A small crowd was already gathering, eager to watch the spectacle. Contestants were beginning to line up, mostly large, burly men in stretched-out shirts and suspenders, boasting and laughing loudly as they eyed the competition. One man, in particular, stood out among them. A massive, towering figure with a belly spilling out from under his too-small tank top, arms crossed and a smug grin on his face. \"Look at this bunch of lightweights!\" he bellowed, patting his stomach with a loud THUMP. \"Ain’t nobody here gonna beat this!\" He grinned widely, turning to the others. \"You’re all lookin’ at the winner, boys! This gut’s been trained for this moment!\" Some of the other contestants laughed nervously, others rolled their eyes. Then the crowd's murmuring grew louder. Heads turned. \"Whoa…\" \"Look at that guy!\" Eli and David approached the registration table, drawing every eye in the tent. Eli's belly was enormous, wobbling heavily with each step. His hoodie was stretched beyond recognition, barely clinging to his sides, while his massive, round gut bounced in front of him like a wrecking ball. The contest area fell into stunned silence. The registration volunteer blinked rapidly as Eli casually leaned on the table. \"Uh… n-name, please?\" she stammered. \"Eli,\" he said with a wide grin, giving his belly a slow, satisfied rub. The volunteer swallowed hard and scribbled his name down. David leaned in with a smirk. \"You sure he’s allowed to compete?\" The woman gave a weak laugh but nervously passed Eli his contestant badge. Meanwhile, the burly man at the end of the table had turned, his grin faltering. His eyes locked on Eli’s massive belly, and his face turned beet red. \"*What the hell is that?!\" he blurted out. The crowd chuckled. Eli smiled sweetly. \"Just here to have some fun,\" Eli said, rubbing his bloated gut. The big man scowled, fists clenching at his sides. \"Pfft, you ain’t gonna last five minutes, balloon boy.\" Eli chuckled softly. \"Guess we’ll see, huh?\" The announcer’s voice crackled over the loudspeaker. \"ALRIGHT, FOLKS! THE CONTEST IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\" Contestants took their seats, trays of pies placed in front of them. The burly man grunted as he sat down, cracking his knuckles. Eli carefully squeezed behind the table, his belly bumping against it with a heavy THUD. \"ON YOUR MARK… GET SET… GO!\" The tent exploded with cheering. Contestants lunged at their pies, stuffing crust and filling into their mouths. But Eli was a machine. CRRRUNCH! He grabbed entire pies with both hands, shoving them into his mouth—barely chewing before swallowing. SLUUURRRP! GLOOOORRRP! Crust, filling, tins—it all vanished.

The burly man grunted, sweat pouring down his face as he stared in disbelief. \"NO WAY!\" \"TIME!\" the announcer shouted. The buzzer blared. The crowd roared as judges scrambled to count. \"Thirty-four pies!\" \"HE WINS!\" Eli leaned back, licking crumbs off his fingers, his belly even larger, groaning under the weight of his victory.

The rest of his gut was completely exposed, glistening with sweat and quivering slightly from the sheer weight of everything he had consumed. David laughed and clapped him on the back. \"You crushed it, man! Nobody even came close!\" Eli grinned lazily, but his half-lidded eyes weren’t done scanning the scene. He looked at the leftover pies scattered across the other contestants’ tables—half-eaten, untouched, abandoned in defeat.

And another. Until every pitcher was empty, and his belly slosh-sloshed under the added weight.

David smirked, assuming the obvious. \"Guess he’s gotta pee after all that.\" But Eli wasn’t heading to the bathroom. He shoved aside a curtain and disappeared into the back storage area of the tent. Stacked high were crates of untouched pies, waiting for the next round or perhaps for sale later in the day. Eli's grin widened. \"Jackpot.\" Without hesitation, he lunged forward. CRRRUNCH! SLUUUURRP! Whole pies vanished in seconds. Crates were knocked over, their contents devoured before they could even hit the ground. GLOOOORRRP! Fruit filling dripped down his chin as he tore through every last pie in storage.

David shook his head, chuckling. \"Man, you’re unstoppable.\" But Eli wasn’t paying attention. His eyes flicked to the side, where the burly man—the one who had mocked him before the contest—was stomping off behind the tent, a cigarette already hanging from his lips. David hadn’t noticed. \"Where are you going now?\" David asked casually, watching Eli start to waddle in the man’s direction. Eli smirked but didn’t answer. \"Bathroom?\" David guessed with a shrug. Eli only chuckled under his breath.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theContestTentBu.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Have a \"talk\" with the huge guy",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theContestTentBu.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Head for the food stalls",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theContestTentBu.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.behindTheContest"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.theContestTentBu.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theFairgroundWas"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theFairgroundWas":[["^The fairground was still buzzing with life as Eli and David made their way back toward the rows of food stalls. But now, all eyes were on Eli. His belly had swollen to an impossible size—so massive that it dragged along the ground, wobbling and shifting with every heavy step. The remains of his shredded hoodie barely clung to his shoulders, doing nothing to cover the enormous, gleaming dome of his stomach. People gasped and stared as they passed. \"Oh my God, look at him!\" \"Is that real?!\" \"How is he even walking?!\" A wide-eyed customer broke from the crowd, stepping toward Eli. Without thinking, the man reached out and gave Eli's bloated belly a few solid pats, the sound like knocking on a thick balloon. \"Damn, man!\" the guy laughed. \"That’s impressive!\" Eli just smirked, giving his stomach a slow, proud rub. \"Thanks,\" he said casually, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. David chuckled beside him. \"You're basically a celebrity now.\" They continued waddling deeper into the fair until they reached a different section, where a large, gothic-style sign loomed over the crowd. \"HAUNTED MANSION – ENTER IF YOU DARE!\" Rusted iron gates creaked open and closed as small carts, designed to carry two people at a time, rolled slowly along the tracks into the dark, fog-filled entrance. Eerie screams and howls echoed from within. Eli's eyes narrowed, and a slow, mischievous grin crept across his face. David caught the look immediately. \"No. Whatever you’re thinking, the answer is no.\" But Eli leaned in, cupping his hand over David's ear and whispered something low. David’s eyes widened slightly. \"Seriously?\" he asked, glancing at Eli's massive belly, then back at the creaking ride. \"You think that’s a good idea?\" Eli chuckled darkly. \"It'll be fun.\" David scratched the back of his neck. \"Or we could… I don’t know, not terrorize people and maybe check out that animal market next door?\" He pointed to a sign nearby: \"LIVE ANIMAL EXHIBIT – Petting Zoo and Livestock Market!\" Eli paused, tapping his chin thoughtfully, his massive belly wobbling slightly.

His face was still red with embarrassment, replaying the moment Eli had humiliated him in front of the entire crowd. \"Stupid kid,\" he growled, taking a long drag. \"Should’ve been my win.\" The sound of heavy, dragging footsteps broke the stillness. THUD. THOOM. The man slowly turned, and his face twisted into a scowl. Eli loomed in the narrow space behind the tent, his massive belly practically blocking the entire path. His bare, bloated gut glistened with sweat, wobbling slightly as he stopped a few feet away. Eli grinned. \"Not so confident now, are you?\" The man’s fist clenched around the cigarette. \"What do you want?\" he spat. \"Come to rub it in?\" Eli chuckled, patting his belly with a slow, heavy thud. \"Nah. Just thought we could… finish what you started.\" The man sneered. \"What’s that supposed to mean?\" Eli’s eyes darkened. \"Exactly what you think it means.\" Before the man could react, Eli lunged forward with terrifying speed for someone his size. \"HEY—\" GLLLLOOOOORRRPP! The man’s scream was cut off as Eli’s mouth stretched impossibly wide, engulfing him in one massive gulp. His massive frame struggled for a split second, fists pounding uselessly against Eli’s bloated gut— Then— GULP. Gone. Eli leaned back with a satisfied sigh, wiping his mouth. His belly quivered and expanded even larger, stretching taut and round. A faint bulge pushed outward, an arm or leg struggling from within before sinking back into the massive dome of flesh. Eli rubbed his swollen gut lazily. \"Now that’s better.\"Back at the Contest Tent David glanced toward the tent’s edge, still casually waiting. \"Man, he’s taking forever,\" David muttered. Moments later, Eli waddled back into view, his belly now even bigger, swaying dangerously low to the ground. David raised an eyebrow. \"Uh... what did you do?\" Eli just grinned, giving his enormous gut a slow, satisfied pat. \"Handled it.\" David stared for a second, then smirked. \"Yeah, I’m not even gonna ask.\" \"Good.\" Eli glanced around the fair, his appetite still not satisfied. \"So… where to next?\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.behindTheContest.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Further into the fair",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.behindTheContest.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theFairgroundWas"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBustlingNoise":[["^The bustling noise of the fairground faded as Eli’s towering, bloated form lumbered toward the vegetable market.Stalls lined the path, overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables—bright red tomatoes, baskets of apples, piles of leafy greens, and stacks of pumpkins.

With a low grunt, he squeezed through the gap, his massive stomach getting stuck for a moment before he forced his way in with a loud THUMP.Inside, the dimly lit space was alive with eerie sounds—cackling laughter, creaking doors, and the occasional distant scream from the ride’s sound effects.Eli paused, blinking in the gloom as his eyes adjusted.\"Spooky,\" he mumbled sarcastically.Slowly, he began waddling deeper into the ride, squeezing between props and low-hanging decorations.Following the rickety tracks, Eli eventually reached the end of the ride where the carts were supposed to emerge from the dark tunnel.He positioned himself next to the tracks, belly swaying slightly as he stood still, blending into the eerie atmosphere.Moments later, a cart rolled toward the exit.A young couple sat inside, laughing and holding onto each other.\"Ahh!\" the girl squealed as a mechanical skeleton lunged toward them.They both laughed—until their eyes caught the looming figure of Eli standing motionless by the tracks.\"Oh wow,\" the guy chuckled nervously. \"Is that part of the ride?\"The girl squeezed his arm. \"That thing looks real!\"Eli didn’t move.Then, slowly, a wide grin spread across his face.And his mouth began to stretch open.WIDER.IMPOSSIBLY WIDE.\"Wha—\"GLLLUUUURRRRPPP!The couple vanished in one massive gulp, the cart clattering forward completely empty. David stood casually near the entrance of the Haunted Mansion, watching as excited fairgoers climbed into the small, creaky carts. Laughter and playful screams echoed from inside as the carts disappeared into the dark ride. But David’s smirk grew when the first empty cart rolled out of the exit. Then the second. Then the third. The ride operator blinked, staring at the growing line of empty carts slowly creeping along the track. \"Wait… what the heck?\" he muttered, leaning into his control booth. He grabbed his radio. \"Control, this is Ride Four. I’m getting empty carts coming out. Can we check the cameras?\" Static. \"Control?\" Nothing. The operator’s face tightened. \"Hold the ride!\" he barked to his assistant. The carts stopped with a mechanical clunk, leaving several still trapped inside the dark maze of the ride. \"I’m sending tech in. Something’s jammed up.\" Two technicians, both wearing branded vests and holding flashlights, exchanged uneasy glances. \"Probably a prop fell on the tracks,\" one muttered, but his voice lacked conviction. David watched them disappear into the dark entrance, the black tunnel swallowing them whole. Inside the Haunted Mansion The air was thick with mechanical groans, eerie music, and the artificial fog that clung to every surface. Dozens of carts had stalled along the tracks, leaving groups of fairgoers sitting in the dark. \"Uh, why did we stop?\" one rider whispered. \"It’s part of the ride,\" another chuckled nervously. \"Right?\" But the shadows seemed to grow darker. Then came a sound. THOOM. Heavy, slow steps echoed in the darkness. \"What is that?\" \"Hello?\" The ground trembled slightly as Eli's massive form moved between the carts, his enormous belly brushing against the walls and the ride props, rattling the sets. A soft, low chuckle reverberated through the dark. Then— GLLLUUUURRRPP! A startled scream was cut off in an instant. \"Did you hear that?!\" \"Where did they go?!\" GLOOOOORRP! Another cart went silent. One by one, the sounds of confused and frightened whispers were replaced by heavy gulps echoing through the halls. The technicians turned a corner, flashlights cutting through the dark. \"Hey!\" one called out. \"Everything okay in here?!\" No answer. Just the sound of something moving toward them. Slowly. Steadily. THOOM. THOOM. \"Oh my—\" SLUUUUUURRRP! Silence. The only remaining sounds were the eerie music looping on the speakers and the soft mechanical creaks of the halted ride.Outside the Haunted Mansion David leaned casually against a fence, watching the entrance. The operator was furiously clicking switches. \"Come on, why isn’t anyone answering?\" He pressed the radio button harder. \"Mike? Sarah? What’s going on in there?!\" Static. \"Control, we need backup at Ride Four. We’ve got a situation—\" The radio crackled, then fell silent. David chuckled quietly, shaking his head. \"Yep,\" he muttered, \"definitely a situation.\" Moments later, something massive shifted behind the tent. The canvas rustled. And then Eli lurched into view from behind the ride, his belly now colossal, dragging along the ground. It was even larger than before, impossibly round and bulging. Underneath the taut, stretched skin, faint shapes pressed and shifted—arms, legs, entire bodies faintly outlined, slowly sinking deeper into the bloated mass. David smirked. \"So… how’d it go?\" Eli let out a heavy, satisfied sigh, wiping sweat from his forehead. \"Nice place,\" Eli mumbled, patting his enormous gut. \"Kinda cramped, though.\" A faint crackling noise suddenly echoed from deep within the stretched mass of his gut.\"...Mike? Sarah? Come in! Can anyone hear me?!\"The panicked voice of the ride operator buzzed through, muffled and distorted, as if coming from a radio buried deep inside Eli’s stomach. David froze for a second, staring at Eli’s belly in disbelief.Then he burst out laughing, doubling over.\"Oh my God,\" David wheezed. \"Did you just eat the radio?!\"Eli blinked in surprise, then grinned and gave his belly a satisfied pat.\"Guess it came with the meal.\"David could barely breathe from laughing.\"Man,\" he chuckled, \"*you are something else.\"Eli smirked. \"Well,\" Eli groaned, giving his belly a slow rub, \"I think I’ve had enough haunted houses for one day.\" \"So... the animal market now?\" David teased.

Rows of pens and cages stretched out before them, filled with squirming livestock. Fat pigs rolled in the mud, fluffy sheep lazily chewed hay, clucking chickens pecked at the dirt, and rows of soft, wide-eyed rabbits twitched their noses from behind wire cages. Farmers and vendors proudly showcased their animals, calling out prices to curious customers. David glanced around, hands in his pockets. \"Huh,\" he mused. \"You wanted to come here. So, what now? Pet a goat?\" But Eli wasn’t listening. His heavy breathing slowed, and his eyes glazed over as he stared at the pens of animals. David’s smile faded. \"...Eli?\" Eli’s stomach let out a long, hungry groooan. David’s eyes widened. \"Oh, no.\" \"So... much... food,\" Eli mumbled, licking his lips. David instinctively grabbed Eli’s arm. \"Dude. No. NO. These are live animals. This is not food!\" But Eli’s grip tightened into fists. His massive belly quivered in anticipation. \"Eli, I’m serious! You can't—\" Eli’s eyes snapped forward, and with a sudden, terrifying burst of speed, he charged. \"ELI, WAIT!\" The Animal Market Erupts Eli barreled through the wooden fencing like it wasn’t even there, splintering the posts with a heavy CRASH! \"HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" \"STOP HIM!\" Vendors and customers screamed as Eli lunged into the first pen, his enormous belly swaying wildly. SLUUUURRRP! Eli grabbed a fat pig and swallowed it whole. The pig's squeal cut off instantly. \"OH MY GOD!\" Panic spread through the crowd. \"RUN!\" Eli didn't even glance at the fleeing people. He turned to the next pen. GLOOOORRP! A panicked sheep disappeared into his gaping maw, wool and all. \"HE'S EATING THE ANIMALS!\" Vendors scrambled to unchain pens and release the animals, but Eli was faster. CHOMP! SLUUURP! Chickens flapped wildly, only to be scooped up and swallowed in bunches, feathers sticking to Eli’s lips. A row of rabbits in their cages didn’t stand a chance. Eli tipped the entire stack over and devoured them, cages and all. David could only watch in horrified disbelief. \"Eli, STOP! What are you doing?!\" But Eli was beyond reason. His massive belly expanded more and more, bulging outward as it sloshed with the weight of dozens of animals. Vendors fled, pulling children away, screaming for help. But Eli didn't care. One by one, every pig, sheep, chicken, and rabbit was devoured. Minutes later, the animal market was silent. Eli stood in the wreckage, breathing heavily.

Eli stood amid the wreckage of the animal market, his massive, swollen belly dragging along the dirt, groaning under the weight of every living creature he had just devoured. His breath was heavy, slow, but his half-lidded eyes gleamed with something more—unrelenting hunger. David cautiously approached, scanning the destruction. \"Okay, Eli,\" David started carefully, \"I think you’ve—\" But Eli wasn’t listening. His gaze drifted to the bustling food stalls in the distance. Rows of stands filled with sizzling meats, towers of sweets, and frosty drinks still operated, oblivious to the devastation nearby. Eli's stomach gave a deep, ominous GROOOOAN. \"Oh no,\" David muttered. \"Not again.\" But it was already too late. \"I’m not finished yet,\" Eli growled, his voice thick with hunger.The Feast Unleashed Eli charged, his titanic belly swaying violently as he plowed into the food court. \"RUN! RUN!\" Vendors screamed as Eli smashed through their stands like a wrecking ball. He tore into the BBQ stand first, ripping entire racks of ribs and brisket off the smoker. CRRUNCH! GLOOOORRP! Bones, sauce, and all—gone. The massive burger stand was next. Eli flipped the entire cart over, causing patties and buns to scatter across the dirt. SLUUURRRP! Trays of burgers, full loaves of bread, even entire wheels of cheese—all devoured. THOOM! He stomped over to the corn-on-the-cob stand, grabbing full crates of butter-drenched corn and pouring them into his mouth. CHOMP! GULP! Hot, buttery corn spilled down his chin as he swallowed whole cobs without slowing. \"HE’S EATING EVERYTHING!\" Vendors fled in every direction, abandoning their carts and screaming for help. But Eli kept moving. He reached the lemonade stand, grabbing the massive plastic containers of fresh lemonade and chugging them down, his throat working overtime. GLUURRRP! Cups, pitchers, ice—everything vanished. David watched in stunned disbelief as Eli's belly grew larger, stretching tighter with each monstrous gulp. Eli stumbled toward the cotton candy stand, greedily yanking massive clouds of spun sugar off their sticks. SLORRRP! Fluffy pink and blue sugar dissolved instantly in his mouth. GLOOOORP! Not satisfied, Eli grabbed the spinning machine itself, tipping it over and slurping the remaining sugar straight from the source. The ground shook beneath him as he lumbered forward. Vendors and fairgoers screamed and scrambled to escape. The parking lot became a disaster as cars screeched and collided, desperate to flee.  But Eli's glazed eyes weren’t done searching.His hunger flared as he turned toward the bustling rows of booths and attractions ahead.Vendors selling toys, games, and trinkets hadn’t even noticed the destruction behind them.But Eli was already moving.\"Eli, WAIT!\" David shouted, but his voice was drowned out by the distant roar of panicked screams.Eli barreled forward, his colossal belly knocking over entire booths.CRAAAASH!A stall selling stuffed animals and carnival games crumpled under his bulk.He swept up massive armfuls of plush toys and plastic prizes—CRRUNCH! GLOOOORRRP!—chewing through them like they were snacks.\"OH MY GOD, RUN!\"\"HE’S DESTROYING EVERYTHING!\"Fairgoers screamed and scattered, pushing each other aside in blind panic.Parents grabbed their children, sprinting toward the parking lot.Car engines roared to life, tires screeched, and horns blared as people tried to escape.BANG!Two cars slammed into each other at the exit, blocking the road.\"MOVE! MOVE!\"But Eli didn’t care.He plowed through the craft booths next, ripping through tables piled with handmade jewelry, clothing, and art.SLUUUURRRP!Tents collapsed as Eli tore through them, swallowing racks of clothing and crates of pottery.Vendors abandoned their goods, screaming in terror. He turned toward the towering Ferris wheel. Without hesitation, he gripped its metal frame and ripped it free with a groaning SCREEEECH. The massive structure tipped and crashed to the ground in a spray of sparks. Eli's jaws stretched impossibly wide. GLLLUUUUUURRRRP! The entire Ferris wheel disappeared into his belly. David staggered back, unable to believe what he was seeing. \"Oh my God...\" But Eli wasn’t finished. He stormed toward the massive carousel, its lights flickering as it slowly spun. Eli grabbed the spinning platform and lifted it from the ground, horses and all, and tilted it back— SLUUUURRRP! Gone. \"HE’S EATING THE RIDES!\" someone screamed. Fairgoers were sprinting in every direction now, their terrified screams blending with the screeching of metal and the cracking of wood. Eli’s enormous belly grew to monstrous proportions, ballooning outward, wobbling with every breath. And then— His eyes locked onto the towering Haunted Mansion. \"No,\" David whispered. \"ELI, STOP!\" But Eli didn’t hesitate. He smashed through the entrance, plowing through walls, props, and tracks. CRRRAAAASH! He devoured the entire structure piece by piece. GLOOOORRRP! Wood, metal, decorations—everything vanished into his belly. Minutes later, there was nothing left. The entire fairground was gone. Every stall. Every ride. Every piece of the festival. All that remained was Eli, collapsed on his back in the middle of the flattened fairground. His belly was now an impossibly massive mountain, rising above him like a fleshy hill. It groaned and shifted, faint shapes pressing against the stretched skin before sinking deeper. David stood near Eli's head, looking tiny in comparison. \"Eli...\" David breathed, unable to form words. Eli let out a deep, sluggish groan. \"Uuuugh... now I think I’m full,\" Eli mumbled, lazily rubbing the side of his massive gut. David let out a long sigh. \"*You think?\" Then— In the far distance, faint but growing louder— WEE-OOO, WEE-OOO. Red and blue lights flickered on the horizon. Police sirens. David’s head snapped toward the sound. \"Oh, great,\" he muttered. \"Here we go again.\" He turned back to Eli, whose half-lidded eyes barely opened. \"Eli, we’ve got company.

David watched nervously as Eli's massive form began lumbering toward the panicked crowd. \"Eli…\" David called out cautiously. \"Don’t.\" But Eli’s focus was razor-sharp. \"No one’s leaving.\" Eli’s stomach groaned in anticipation. Then, he charged. \"GO! GO! MOVE!\" \"IT’S COMING THIS WAY!\" Cars slammed into each other, tires spun wildly, but it was no use. Eli grabbed the nearest car, effortlessly lifting it off the ground. The driver screamed inside as Eli tilted the vehicle back— GLLLLUUUURRRP! The entire car, metal and all, slid down his throat. \"NO! NO! GO BACK!\" Panicked drivers tried to reverse, but Eli was faster. He snatched another car, tilting it upright. GLOOOORRRRP! Car after car vanished into Eli’s gaping maw. Families inside didn’t even have time to scream before being swallowed whole. David could only stare in horrified disbelief. \"Eli, STOP!\" But Eli didn’t even hear him. One by one, every car in the parking lot was consumed. Metal crunched, glass shattered, and screams were cut off in massive, wet gulps. SLUUURRRP! Minutes later, the parking lot was empty. Not a single car. Not a single person. Only deep tire marks and cracked pavement remained. Eli stood there, his belly now grotesquely massive, stretching far beyond anything imaginable.

With a guttural grunt, he ripped the ride from its base, tilting it back— GLLLLUUUURRRP! The entire ride slid into his belly. The ground trembled beneath his weight. The carousel was next. The spinning platform crumpled as Eli devoured it whole, horses and all. The Haunted Mansion—flattened and consumed. Every stand, every ride, every vendor, every guest. No one escaped. Eli consumed everything. The fairground fell into eerie silence. Screams and chaos had been replaced by an eerie silence, broken only by the distant sound of Eli’s labored breathing. He lay sprawled on his back in the middle of the flattened grounds, his belly now a grotesque, monstrous dome of flesh. It stretched impossibly high, rising like a fleshy mountain that dominated the landscape. His skin was pulled painfully taut, so thin in places it looked nearly translucent. Deep stretch marks spiderwebbed across the bloated surface, glowing red against the strain. Horrifying, wet groans and creaks echoed from deep inside his gut, followed by sharp, ominous pops of skin stretching to its limit. David stood beside Eli's head, looking tiny in comparison, his eyes wide with disbelief. \"Eli...\" David’s voice was barely more than a whisper. Eli’s face was pale and slick with sweat. His teeth were clenched tightly, his eyes squeezed shut. \"Nnngh...\" Eli groaned, his body trembling.

Eli winced, beads of sweat rolling down his face. \"I... I don't know how much more I can hold it...\" David’s face tightened in panic. \"Okay, okay, breathe. Just—hold it together, man!\" But even David wasn’t sure if Eli’s stomach could take another second. The enormous belly quaked, shifting dangerously, as if it might burst at any moment. Then— WEE-OOO, WEE-OOO. The distant wail of police sirens broke through the still air. David’s head snapped toward the sound. Flashing red and blue lights began to flicker on the horizon, drawing closer with every second. \"Oh, great,\" David muttered, panic creeping into his voice. \"*Eli, the cops are coming.

Angry red stretch marks crisscrossed the swollen mass, and deep, unsettling bubbling sounds rumbled from within. David stood frozen by Eli’s head, his face pale as the flashing red and blue lights grew closer. Police cruisers skidded to a stop, sirens blaring. Doors slammed. Guns were raised. \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!\" an officer shouted. Another let out a sharp, nervous whistle. \"You've gotta be kidding me...\" The Chief stepped forward, his boots crunching on the dirt, megaphone gripped tightly in one hand, baton in the other. \"ATTENTION!\" his voice boomed through the megaphone. \"STEP AWAY FROM—WHATEVER THAT THING IS!\" Eli let out a weak, strained groan. \"P-please... don't...\" The Chief sneered, lowering the megaphone. \"What the hell are you?\" Without warning, he marched forward and jabbed his baton into Eli’s belly.

David stepped forward, alarmed. \"Hey, man, seriously—don't do that!\" But the Chief wasn’t listening. Disgust twisted across his face. \"Whatever this is, it shouldn’t exist.\" THWACK!

David’s eyes widened in horror. \"STOP!\" he screamed. \"HE’S GONNA—\" THWACK! The final strike drove deep into Eli's stomach. For one fleeting moment, everything was still. Then— KAAAAA-THOOOOOOM!!! The explosion was cataclysmic. A deafening shockwave ripped through the air, splitting the ground apart. A searing blast of force erupted outward in all directions, flattening everything in its path. Police cruisers were launched like missiles, spiraling through the sky before disappearing beyond the horizon. Officers were catapulted into the air, their bodies flung miles away, vanishing as tiny specks against the sky. David was hurled backward, his silhouette rocketing into the clouds until it was swallowed by the sky.  A hurricane of debris shot outward, a swirling storm of wood, metal, and dust. When the dust finally began to settle, there was nothing left. No people. No structures. No sound. Only a massive, smoking crater carved deep into the earth—silent and still. The fairground had been erased. And above the smoldering pit, the distant echo of the explosion rumbled into silence.","\n","^<strong>\"Guess Eli just won the prize for biggest explosion.

David leaned back comfortably, absentmindedly scrolling through his phone, while Eli lay sprawled beside him, lazily flipping through TV channels. David smirked slightly, eyes still on his phone. \"You know... I've been planning something. A little surprise.\" Eli's head snapped towards him, eyes gleaming with curiosity. \"A surprise? What kind of surprise?\" David shrugged, playing it cool. \"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.\" David smirked, still staring at his phone. \"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.\" Eli's eyes narrowed with a mischievous glint. \"Oh, really? So you're just going to tease me like that?\" David chuckled, not even looking up. \"Yup.\" Eli leaned in closer, his grin spreading. \"Alright, fine. But you know what happens if you don't tell me?\" David raised an eyebrow, smirking. \"Oh? And what's that?\" Without warning, Eli slowly opened his mouth in an exaggerated, playful way, eyes locked on David's. He reached out and gently grabbed David's hand, bringing it toward his lips. \"Eli…\" David warned, though his voice was more amused than serious. Eli ignored him, smirking as he sensually wrapped his lips around David's fingers, sucking lightly on each one, his tongue teasing the spaces between. David let out a low breath, the smirk still on his face, though his eyes darkened slightly. \"You're ridiculous.\" Eli didn’t stop. He slowly pulled more of David's hand into his mouth, inching up until his entire palm disappeared past his lips. His eyes stayed locked on David's, daring him to react. David remained still, unfazed, though the slight shift in his seat and the growing tightness in his jeans betrayed how much the game affected him. Eli gave one last teasing suck before slowly pulling David's hand free with a wet pop. He leaned in, grinning wide. \"Tell me, or next time I won’t stop at your hand.\" David chuckled, shaking his head. \"If you eat me, Eli, you’ll never find out what the surprise is.\" Eli groaned dramatically, flopping back against the couch. \"Ugh! You're no fun!\" David smirked, flexing his fingers as he relaxed again. \"Oh, I’m plenty of fun. You just have to be patient.\" The rest of the afternoon passed with David dropping vague hints and Eli throwing out increasingly ridiculous guesses, each more exaggerated than the last. But David remained stubbornly silent. Later that evening, after Eli finished his shower, he walked into the living room, towel still draped around his neck. His eyes immediately caught something on the coffee table—a sleek envelope tied with a deep red ribbon. Eli tilted his head. \"What's this?\" David was casually sitting on the couch, pretending to focus on the TV, but a sly smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. \"Oh, that? No idea. Must’ve just appeared there.\" Rolling his eyes, Eli snatched the envelope and carefully undid the ribbon. He slid out a crisp certificate and stared at it for a moment, reading the elegant print. His jaw slowly dropped. \"No way... A three-week all-inclusive ocean cruise?!\" David finally turned to face him, grinning. \"Surprise.\" Eli was speechless for a few seconds before practically bouncing in place. \"David! This is insane! When do we leave? What kind of food do they have? Oh man, I bet they have endless buffets!\" David chuckled. \"We set sail next weekend. And yeah, endless food.

Crowds bustled around the boarding ramps, excited passengers dragging their luggage and snapping photos. Among them, Eli practically bounced on his heels, barely able to contain his excitement. David followed behind him, rolling their suitcase with a relaxed smile. \"Calm down, Eli. The ship’s not going anywhere without us.\" Eli turned to him with wide eyes. \"David, this thing is huge! It’s like a floating city! Do you think they have a map or something? What if we get lost?\" David chuckled. \"That’s part of the adventure.\" Once they boarded, the scale of the ship truly hit them. Grand staircases, glittering chandeliers, and endless hallways stretched in every direction. The air buzzed with chatter and the distant sound of music. Their cabin was cozy yet modern, with a large window offering a stunning view of the ocean. Eli immediately flopped onto the bed, arms spread wide. \"Okay, this is already amazing. But where’s the food?\" David chuckled, setting their bag down. \"We just got here. Let’s take a look around first, alright?\" Eli groaned but agreed, trailing after David as they explored the ship. They passed by elegant dining halls, sprawling buffets, sparkling pools, theaters, and even a mini-golf course. Eli’s eyes darted from one attraction to another, but every time they passed a buffet, his stomach growled loudly. Grrrrrrruuuuughhh! David glanced at him with a smirk. \"That thing's louder than the ship’s horn.\" Eli clutched his belly dramatically. \"David, it’s not my fault! The food is calling me!\" David shook his head, amused. \"We can check out the pool deck first, maybe the theater—\" GGRRRRRROOOOWWL! Eli whined, tugging on David’s sleeve. \"Please, David! Just one plate. Maybe two. Or three. Then we can look around!\" David sighed, but his grin gave him away. \"Alright, alright. Let’s get you fed before you start chewing on the furniture.\" Eli lit up instantly. \"Yes! Let’s go!\" They made their way into one of the massive buffet halls. Long tables stretched endlessly, piled high with every kind of cuisine imaginable—pasta, seafood, grilled meats, endless desserts. The air was thick with mouthwatering aromas. David grabbed a tray casually, but Eli stood frozen for a moment, eyes sparkling in awe.

Long tables groaned under the weight of every imaginable dish—roasted meats, fresh seafood, towering desserts, and trays of steaming sides. The air was thick with rich aromas, and Eli was practically vibrating with excitement. Without hesitation, Eli grabbed two trays and began piling them high, stacking plate after plate with mountains of food. By the time he sat down, his trays were overflowing. David watched with a raised eyebrow, casually sipping his drink. \"You do realize this is only the first buffet, right?\" Eli didn’t answer. He was too busy devouring everything in sight—scooping pasta, tearing into ribs, and stuffing pastries into his mouth without pause. His eating was relentless. Plate after plate vanished, and as he leaned back in his chair, his belly was now pushing hard against his shirt, rounding out into a firm, bloated sphere. The bottom of his t-shirt rode up, revealing his stretched, smooth skin. GGGRRRROOOOWLLL... Eli let out a heavy sigh, rubbing both hands over his swollen belly. \"Mmm… so good…\" David leaned forward, lowering his voice. \"Okay, Eli. Maybe slow down a bit, yeah?

We can check out another buffet so it’s not as obvious… or we could hit the pool.

Endless rows of steaming dishes stretched out before him—grilled meats, creamy pastas, crispy fried treats, and desserts piled high. Eli’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he grabbed two trays and immediately began stacking them with reckless abandon. Mountains of food quickly formed on his plates—double helpings of everything. David trailed behind, watching with a mix of amusement and mild concern. \"Eli… maybe pace yourself a little?\" But Eli was already seated, devouring food with unstoppable energy. He shoveled mouthful after mouthful, barely pausing to chew. Plates emptied in seconds, only to be replaced by more. His belly began to swell rapidly, rounding out as it strained against his shirt. The hem of his t-shirt crept higher until it barely covered the top of his stomach, leaving the smooth, tight skin fully exposed. As Eli kept eating, his gut expanded further, drooping between his legs, heavy and taut. GRRRRROOOOAAAANNNN The sound wasn’t just from Eli’s belly—it was from the nearby tables. Passengers had started to notice. Curious glances turned into sideways whispers. “Is he okay?” someone muttered. “Look at how much he’s eating…” another whispered. “His stomach… it’s massive!” David glanced around, noticing the growing attention. His eyes flicked back to Eli, who was still stuffing his face, cheeks puffed out, completely oblivious. \"Eli,\" David leaned in, his voice low but firm. \"Hey. Eli.\" Eli paused, cheeks full, eyes half-lidded in bliss. \"Mmm?\" David gestured subtly to the other guests, many now openly staring. \"You’re kind of putting on a show here. If you keep going like this, we’re going to get kicked out—or worse, people are going to start filming you.\" Eli blinked, looking around. He noticed the stares, the hushed voices. His bloated belly gurgled loudly, resting heavily between his legs, stretched so tight it seemed ready to pop. Eli groaned, leaning back, both hands slowly rubbing his enormous gut. \"Ughhh… but I’m still… so hungry…\" David raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, well, maybe let’s not eat this entire buffet in front of everyone. How about we check out another one—spread it out a little—or maybe hit the cinema for a bit?\" Eli let out a long, exaggerated sigh, still gently rocking his swollen belly. \"Fine… but only because my legs are going numb.\" David chuckled, standing up. \"Come on, let’s go before they bring out security.\" Eli groaned again, struggling to stand, his bloated stomach wobbling as he slowly got to his feet.

The air was thick with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling meats, fresh bread, and sugary desserts. Endless food stations stretched in every direction—carving stations, pasta bars, seafood towers, and dessert tables that looked like works of art. Eli’s eyes widened with excitement as they stepped in, his stomach letting out an eager grrrrgle. David placed a firm hand on Eli’s shoulder. \"Okay, listen. Maybe this time we take it easy. How about I bring the food to you? That way you’re not out there drawing attention to yourself.\" Eli blinked in surprise. \"Wait… really? You’ll bring me food?\" David smirked. \"Yeah. Just sit tight, and I’ll keep the plates coming. It’s safer than letting you rampage through the buffet.\" Eli didn’t protest. He practically bounced into a booth near the corner, the soft cushions creaking as he sat down. He leaned forward eagerly, tapping his fingers on the table. \"Okay, okay! Go! I’m starving!\" David chuckled and made his way to the buffet stations. He returned with two full plates—one stacked with grilled meats and the other loaded with pasta and sides. Eli immediately dug in, devouring everything in record time. Forks scraped plates, and in less than a minute, both were spotless. Eli leaned back, pouting. \"That’s it? Two plates? David, you know that’s not enough!\" David sighed. \"Fine, I’ll get more.\" As David got up, Eli’s eyes wandered. A few booths down, he spotted something that made him freeze mid-bite. An extremely obese couple sat in a corner booth, plates piled high in front of them. The man had to weigh at least 400 pounds, his stomach pressed against the table, while the woman beside him wasn’t far behind. Both were shoveling food into their mouths at a steady, relentless pace, barely pausing to breathe. Eli narrowed his eyes. \"They get to eat like that, but I can’t?\" he muttered under his breath. David returned with another pair of plates. Before Eli could dig in, he gestured toward the couple. \"David, look at them! They’re eating like machines, and I’m stuck here waiting for scraps!\" David followed Eli’s gaze and raised an eyebrow. He hadn’t noticed them before, but the way they devoured their food was something else. For a moment, David hesitated. Then he sighed. \"Okay, fine. You’ve got a point.\" Eli’s eyes lit up. David smirked. \"I’ll bring more this time. Just… keep it quiet, alright?\" Eli clapped his hands excitedly. \"Now we’re talking!\" David started stacking plates higher, returning with four, then six plates at a time. Eli eagerly tore through each one, savoring every bite. David returned with another towering stack of plates, carefully balancing them as he approached the booth. Eli’s eyes sparkled with excitement, and without missing a beat, he dove back into the feast, devouring every bite with unrelenting speed. A few tables away, a young waiter stood by the drink station, absentmindedly wiping a glass. His eyes kept drifting toward Eli. He was tall and lean, with neatly styled dark hair and sharp features, but his usual professional demeanor seemed to falter. His gaze lingered on Eli’s relentless eating—the way he tore through plate after plate, the subtle way his belly had started to round out under his shirt. There was something about Eli’s unashamed hunger, the casual confidence in how he indulged, that clearly fascinated him. The waiter’s grip on the glass tightened slightly, and a faint, curious smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. He quickly looked away when another server passed by but couldn’t help stealing another glance at Eli from the corner of his eye. Whatever it was, Eli’s appetite wasn’t just drawing attention—it was pulling him in.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The obese couple notice competition",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The young waiter offers help",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.4.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str",{"VAR?":"joey"},"/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-2","flg":3},{"s":["^Famous encounter",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidHurriedBack"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-2.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.4.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"thePoolDeckWasAl":[["^The pool deck was alive with energy—kids splashing in the water, people lounging on chairs, and the sounds of rushing water from various slides and fountains. Massive water slides twisted above, dumping excited riders into the pools below. Hot tubs bubbled in the corners, and fountains sprayed arcs of water across the bright, sunlit space. David and Eli stepped out onto the deck, now dressed in their swimwear. David looked relaxed in his swim trunks and towel slung over his shoulder, but Eli… Eli looked downright ridiculous. His swim trunks clung awkwardly beneath the massive, round dome of his stuffed belly, which jutted out in front of him like an overinflated beach ball. The way it bounced slightly as he walked only added to the comical effect. David smirked, trying to hold back a laugh. \"You look like you swallowed the pool.\" Eli stuck his tongue out. \"Very funny. The water will help me digest!\" Before David could respond, Eli waddled toward the edge of the pool and launched himself into the water with a loud SPLASH! But the second he hit the water, something went terribly wrong. His massive, heavy belly dragged him straight down like a stone. BLUB-BLUB-BLUB! David's eyes widened. \"Eli?!\" Without thinking, David dove in after him, cutting through the water. He spotted Eli sinking awkwardly, limbs flailing in slow motion as bubbles escaped from his mouth. David grabbed Eli under his arms and kicked hard, pulling him back up. They burst through the surface, Eli gasping for breath. David coughed, dragging him toward the shallow end. \"Are you insane?! You sank like a rock!\" Eli wheezed, sputtering water, but grinned sheepishly. \"Guess… guess I’m not as buoyant as I thought…\" David shook his head, helping Eli settle into the shallower water. \"Just stay where you can stand, alright?\" Eli nodded, still catching his breath. \"Yeah, yeah… shallow water it is.\" Eli relaxed, playfully splashing water around and enjoying the coolness. David drifted off to swim a few laps, keeping a casual eye on him. Eli, meanwhile, was slowly drifting toward the far end of the pool, where the giant tubes of the water slides emptied riders into the water. He floated lazily, watching the streams of water splash down. Without realizing it, he got a little too close. Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught a blur of movement.","\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^WHEEEEEEEEEEEE! A high-pitched scream echoed from the water slide above. Before Eli could react, a girl shot out of the tube at full speed, skimming across the water—directly toward him. Eli barely had time to blink. Instinctively, his mouth dropped open in shock. FWUMP! The girl disappeared straight into his open mouth. Eli's cheeks bulged slightly, his eyes wide in surprise. He froze, processing what had just happened. Then… slowly, a mischievous grin crept across his face. David, still swimming laps, hadn’t noticed a thing.

Posters for the latest movies lined the walls, but Eli's eyes were fixed on the concession stand, practically drooling. David sighed knowingly. \"Let me guess—you want popcorn?\" Eli grinned wide. \"Popcorn, candy, nachos, and the biggest soda they have. Oh! And maybe some chocolate bars too!\" Moments later, the two of them staggered into the theater, arms overloaded with food. David carried two giant tubs of popcorn and two massive cups of cola, while Eli clutched piles of candy, nachos, and even a bag of gummy worms. They climbed all the way to the back row, settling into the far corner where they could spread out without being disturbed. The theater was mostly empty—just a few scattered people here and there. As the trailers began rolling, Eli wasted no time. Crunch. Slurp. Munch. By the time the opening title of Dune appeared on the screen, Eli was already licking the chocolate off his fingers, surrounded by empty wrappers and a hollow popcorn tub. His slightly bloated belly peeked out from under his shirt, rising and falling as he let out a soft sigh. He nudged David. \"Hey… can you go grab more?\" David gave him a deadpan stare. \"Seriously? Eli, the movie just started.\" \"But I’m still hungry!\" Eli whined, rubbing his belly dramatically. \"Come on, please? Just one more round!\" David groaned. \"You know, if you wanted to eat this much, we could’ve gone back to the buffet.\" Eli pouted, giving him big, sad eyes. David rolled his eyes. \"Fine. But this is the last time.\" He carefully climbed over the row of seats and left the theater. At the concession stand, the cashier chuckled as David placed another massive order. \"Back so soon? Didn’t you just get all this?\" David rubbed his temple. \"Yeah, don’t ask.\" With both arms full of fresh popcorn buckets and oversized sodas, David made his way back to the theater. David pushed open the heavy theater door, carefully balancing two oversized buckets of popcorn and massive sodas in his arms. The familiar scent of buttery popcorn filled the air, but something felt… off. The theater was silent. When they had first sat down, there had been a few scattered people—couples, solo moviegoers, quietly settling in for the film. But now, as David’s eyes adjusted to the dim light, he noticed something strange. The theater was completely empty. Except for Eli. Slumped in the very back row, Eli sat alone, staring intensely at the massive screen. David froze for a second. Where did everyone go? He started walking up the steps slowly. But halfway up, he stopped dead in his tracks. Eli’s belly was enormous. It ballooned out in front of him, so massive it swallowed up three seats in the row ahead. The metal armrests of the chairs were bent outward, some seats completely crushed under the weight. His gut stretched so far forward it nearly touched the seats in the next row. The dim glow of the movie screen flickered across Eli's round, taut belly, casting shadows that made it look even more ridiculous. David stared, eyes wide. \"Eli.\" Eli didn’t move, pretending to be completely absorbed in the movie. David narrowed his eyes and climbed the remaining steps, stopping right beside him. \"Eli. What. Did. You. Do?\" Eli slowly turned his head, cheeks flushed red. \"W-what? I’m just watching the movie!\" David gestured at the destroyed seats and Eli’s gigantic belly. \"Oh, really? Because it looks like you ate the audience.\" Eli gave a sheepish grin, awkwardly patting his massive stomach. \"They were blocking my view!\" David’s jaw dropped. \"Blocking your— Eli! They were sitting scattered around the auditorium!\" Eli huffed, crossing his arms as best he could. \"Well, now they’re not.\" David groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"If you keep this up, there won’t be anyone left on this ship! You know what? Go ahead and clear out the entire buffet, but stop eating people!\" Eli’s eyes lit up instantly. \"Really?\" Before David could take it back, Eli snatched the snacks from his hands and inhaled them in seconds—popcorn, soda, candy, all gone. His massive belly gave a deep, content gurgle. Then Eli gripped the armrests, trying to rock himself forward. \"Okay! Let’s go to the buffet!\" David stared at him, deadpan. \"You cannot walk out there like that.\" Eli blinked. \"Why not?\" David gestured to the colossal belly still crushing several rows of seats. \"Because if you waddle out with that, security will be here in five minutes! You need to do something about it.\" Eli slumped, frowning. \"Ugh… do I have to?\" David crossed his arms. \"Yes. Either you shrink that thing down or we’re staying right here.\" Eli let out a loud, dramatic sigh. \"Fine… but I’m definitely getting more food after this.\" David rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just hurry up.\" Eli took a deep breath, grunted softly, and slowly started deflating. His massive belly groaned and gurgled as it shrank, the tight skin softening and retreating bit by bit. Once he was back to a manageable size, Eli sighed in relief. David smirked. \"Alright, let’s go.

Across the room, a massively overweight couple sat hunched over their own overflowing table. The man had to weigh at least 400 pounds, his bloated stomach pressing firmly against the edge of the table, while his partner—only slightly smaller—was devouring her food just as aggressively. The man glanced up from his plate, catching sight of Eli’s feast. He nudged the woman beside him with his elbow, grunting as he nodded in Eli’s direction. Her eyes narrowed as she followed his gaze. Without a word, both of them leaned in, grabbed fistfuls of food, and began shoveling it in faster—chewing loudly, swallowing without pause. The woman grunted and heaved herself up, her thick legs wobbling as she shuffled toward the buffet. Her stretched dress clung to every curve, and the fabric creaked under the strain. She returned moments later with two trays stacked high with fried foods and dripping desserts. Eli noticed their sudden intensity and smirked to himself. Oh, so that’s how it’s gonna be? Challenge accepted. Eli leaned in, grabbing entire plates in both hands, stuffing his mouth without hesitation. David returned with more plates, barely able to set them down before Eli devoured them. \"Okay, this is getting ridiculous. I can’t carry it fast enough!\" Eli didn’t even answer, too busy eating, his belly swelling faster and rounder, pushing his shirt up over his skin. Across the room, the couple was struggling but determined. The man’s bloated gut strained against his shirt—POP!—the front button shot off and clattered to the floor. He groaned but kept eating. His belt snapped next, the buckle swinging loose. His pants split slightly along the seams. The woman wasn’t faring much better. Her stretch dress was maxed out, the seams along her side beginning to tear with small, audible rips. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she forced down more cake. But it was no use. An hour passed, and the strain was too much. The man slumped back into the booth, groaning, his hands cradling his swollen gut. His shirt hung open, buttons gone, and his stomach heaved with each breath. The woman dropped her fork, gasping for air, her dress visibly torn at the sides. Both of them were utterly defeated. The man glanced over at Eli—who was still going—and with a tired smirk, he raised a shaky thumbs-up. Eli leaned back, finally slowing down. His belly was enormous now, sagging heavily between his legs and practically touching the floor. His breathing was slow and deep, but a smug grin stretched across his face. As he lazily rubbed his monstrous stomach, Eli caught movement from the corner of his eye. The young waiter from earlier was still there, standing near the edge of the room, half-hiding behind a pillar. His eyes were locked on Eli, completely mesmerized by the display. Eli smirked, locking eyes with him for a second. And then, with a slow, playful wink, Eli let his hand slide across his swollen gut. The waiter blinked, startled, his face flushing red before he quickly looked away. Eli chuckled to himself. \"Hey, David,\" he mumbled, barely able to speak through his stuffed belly, \"I think I’m winning today.\" David, returning with yet another plate, stared at him and sighed. \"Yeah, yeah.

Out of the corner of his eye, Eli noticed the young waiter from earlier lingering near the drink station. The guy had been sneaking glances for a while now, nervously fidgeting with his apron. But this time, the waiter took a deep breath and cautiously approached the table, clutching a notepad he clearly didn’t need. “H-hey,” the waiter stammered, his voice cracking slightly. “I, uh… I couldn’t help but notice you’re really enjoying the food here.” Eli grinned, eyes glinting with amusement. “Yeah, you could say that.” The waiter chuckled nervously, shifting on his feet. Eli’s eyes drifted downward for a brief second and immediately caught the obvious bulge in the waiter’s pants. The poor guy flushed bright red, clearing his throat awkwardly. “I was wondering,” the waiter blurted out, “if you’d like me to… um, bring you more food? Like, instead of you waiting. I mean, I can bring whatever you want. Anything. As much as you want.” Eli chuckled, raising an eyebrow. “Oh, you’re offering full service now?” The waiter’s face went even redder. “I-I mean—yes! I just thought… it’d be easier for you.” Eli smirked. “Yeah, I bet you did.” He gave his belly a slow, deliberate rub and leaned in slightly. “Sure. Knock yourself out.” The waiter beamed. “R-really? Great! I’ll start right away!” As the waiter hurried off toward the buffet, Eli shook his head, laughing softly to himself. Right at that moment, David returned, balancing several plates. He paused mid-step, noticing the interaction. David raised an eyebrow. “Making friends now, are we?” Eli grinned. “Looks like I got myself a personal waiter.” David set the plates down and smirked. “Oh, how charming. What’d you promise him, a bite of that belly?” Eli snorted with laughter. “Please, this belly’s invite-only.” Moments later, the waiter reappeared with several heaping plates and carefully set them down in front of Eli, not even glancing at David. “Here you go! If you need more, just wave me over!” Eli casually grabbed a fork. “Oh, trust me. I’ll need more.” The waiter lingered for a moment, nervously shifting again. “S-so… do you always eat like this?” Eli smirked mid-bite. “Let’s just say I’m good at what I do.” The waiter laughed softly, still clearly flustered. “If… if you run out of space, I can always bring smaller portions.” Eli grinned, picking up a fork. \"You know,\" he said between bites, \"I bet I could fit this entire ship in here.\"With that, Eli leaned back slightly and gave his massive belly a loud, proud slap.THWUMP.The sound echoed in the quiet buffet hall.The waiter froze mid-step, his eyes widening. His knees seemed to buckle slightly as his face flushed a deep red.\"I-I…\" the waiter stammered, gripping the edge of the table for support.David, watching from across the table, raised an eyebrow. \"Careful, kid. He might actually try it.\"Eli chuckled, still shoveling food into his mouth.As the clock ticked closer to midnight, David rubbed his eyes and let out a tired sigh. \"Eli, it’s almost midnight. Maybe—just maybe—we should call it a night?\"Eli, still chewing, barely looked up. \"I’m not done yet.\"David groaned and leaned back. His eyelids were heavy, and his posture slouched. \"Unbelievable…\"He glanced at the young waiter, who looked equally worn out. His shoulders sagged, and his movements had slowed to a crawl.\"Hey,\" David called out, \"weren’t you supposed to be off your shift, like, hours ago?\"The waiter gave a weak chuckle, adjusting his apron. \"Yeah… I was. But I didn’t want to leave him hanging.\" He gestured at Eli’s massive form.David smirked. \"Wow. Dedicated service.\"The waiter smiled tiredly but kept bringing more trays. His steps grew heavier, and his eyes drooped, but he pushed on.Finally, on one of his last trips, the waiter returned with a tray barely held in his trembling hands. He placed it on the table with a soft clunk, swaying on his feet.Without warning, he leaned forward and slumped face-first onto Eli’s enormous belly.THUMP.He was out cold, softly snoring, his head rising and falling with Eli’s slow, heavy breaths.David blinked. Then smirked. \"Well, look at that. You broke your toy.\"Eli paused mid-bite and looked down at the sleeping waiter. \"Oops.\"David rubbed his face, groaning. \"Okay, that’s it. We’re done here.\"He reached over and gently shook the waiter’s shoulder. \"Hey, buddy. Time to wake up.\"The waiter stirred, blinking in confusion. \"Huh? Wha—?\"David gestured toward Eli. \"Help me get this walking food coma back to the cabin.\"Still groggy, the waiter nodded and stumbled to his feet. Together, they tried guiding Eli out of the booth.But Eli’s belly, now massive and bloated beyond belief, made moving difficult.David grunted, pushing from behind. \"Come on, Eli, move it!\"Eli groaned, struggling to stand. \"I’m trying!\"They shuffled down the hallway, slowly making their way to the cabin.When they reached the door, David’s face fell.\"Uh… we’ve got a problem.\"The doorway was… narrow. Much narrower than Eli’s current girth.Eli blinked at the door, then down at his belly. \"Oh. Uh…\"David sighed. \"Perfect.\"The waiter rubbed his eyes and muttered, \"Okay… on three. One… two… three!\"Both David and the waiter pushed with all their strength. Eli grunted as his bloated body wedged into the doorframe. SCRRRTCHHH! With one last shove, Eli popped through, tumbling forward into the cabin with a loud THUD.David panted, leaning against the wall. \"I can’t believe that worked.\"The waiter, barely standing, gave a tired smile. \"Happy to help.\"David smirked. \"You should probably get some sleep. You’ve earned it.\"The waiter nodded slowly, his eyelids drooping. \"Yeah… I think I’ll do that.\"Eli, sprawled out on the cabin floor, let out a contented sigh, hands resting on his massive belly. \"Night, guys…\"The waiter chuckled softly, turning to leave. \"Goodnight.\"As he staggered down the hallway, David closed the door behind him and shook his head. \"What a day.\"He glanced back at Eli, already dozing off. David chuckled to himself. \"Three weeks of this… I’m gonna need a vacation after this vacation.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Breakfast buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theMorningSunStr1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBustlingNoise1":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The bustling noise of the buffet was a chaotic symphony of clinking cutlery and murmured conversations. David sat at their table, eyeing Eli’s growing pile of empty plates with a mix of amazement and mild concern. But something caught his attention a few tables away.David leaned in, whispering, “Eli, don’t look now, but… isn’t that Joey Chestnut?”Eli froze mid-bite, his eyes narrowing. Slowly, he turned his head, pretending to stretch, and there he was—the legendary competitive eater, seated in a booth with a group of friends, chatting and laughing over modest portions.Eli’s lips curled into a mischievous grin. “Pathetic,” he muttered, already scheming.Rising from the table, Eli grabbed a tray and headed to the buffet line, loading it with burgers, hotdogs, and a towering pile of sides. On his way back, he deliberately walked past Joey’s booth, casting a haughty glance and smirking.“Small portions for a small stomach,” Eli said loudly enough for the table to hear. “Pathetic capacity.”Joey’s laughter stopped abruptly, his friends falling silent. His eyebrows furrowed, and he turned to look at Eli, who sauntered back to his table as if nothing had happened.One of Joey’s friends nudged him. “You gonna let him say that?”Joey stood up slowly, his face calm but his pride clearly wounded. “Alright,” he said, rolling up his sleeves. “Let’s see who’s really pathetic.” The bustling buffet turned into a silent battleground as Eli and Joey squared off. The room buzzed with anticipation as word spread quickly about the impromptu eating contest. Diners whispered, waitstaff peeked nervously from behind counters, and even the kitchen staff had stopped to watch.Eli smirked, leaning casually over his already impressive mound of empty plates. Joey, in contrast, sat upright, his faded Nathan’s Famous t-shirt snug against his chest. His friends murmured encouragements, their confidence wavering as they eyed Eli’s growing collection of demolished trays. Joey started strong, grabbing two burgers at once and shoving them into his mouth with mechanical precision. His jaw moved like a machine, effortlessly breaking down each bite. THUD! The first empty tray hit the table, and his friends erupted into cheers.Eli wasn’t fazed. He leaned back, grabbed a towering burger from his tray, and swallowed it in three massive bites. “Not bad,” Eli teased, wiping his mouth. “For an amateur.”Joey’s jaw tightened. He grabbed a trio of hotdogs, dunked them in water, and stuffed all three into his mouth. The crowd gasped. His throat bulged as he swallowed, his belly starting to press visibly against the edge of the table.Eli, unfazed, grabbed a stack of sliders and shoved them in one by one, his gaze locked on Joey’s widening eyes. His belly swelled outward, pressing into the table with each new bite. By now, the air was thick with tension. Joey was visibly sweating, his friends nervously cheering him on as he grabbed another tray of burgers. His stomach, once flat and muscular, was rounding out, his t-shirt stretching tighter and tighter. Faint creaks came from his chair as it strained under the increasing weight.Eli leaned forward, his belly pressing comfortably into the table. He grabbed a heaping pile of fries, stuffing them into his mouth with both hands. “This is barely a warm-up,” Eli taunted, patting his growing midsection.Joey, red-faced but determined, grabbed another burger and shoved it into his mouth. The veins on his forehead stood out, and his chest heaved as he swallowed hard. His stomach expanded even further, now pressing into the table with such force that the wood creaked ominously. Joey’s friends looked on in horror as his belly ballooned further. The Nathan’s Famous logo on his shirt was stretched beyond recognition. His breathing was ragged, and beads of sweat rolled down his face. He grabbed a hotdog with shaking hands, shoving it into his mouth despite his body screaming for him to stop.Eli, meanwhile, smirked and grabbed another burger. He popped it into his mouth with ease, patting his own bloated belly. “Still holding up, champ?” he taunted.Joey’s hands trembled as he reached for another burger. His friends begged him to stop.“Joey, don’t!” one of them cried.But Joey shook his head. “No way… I’m not losing to him.”He shoved the burger into his mouth. His stomach groaned audibly. GROOOOAAAAN. The entire room fell silent as Joey froze, his face twisting in discomfort.CRREEEEEAAAAKKK! His belly stretched even further, pressing against the edge of the table. His t-shirt strained to hold back the growing dome, faint tearing noises coming from the seams.“Joey, stop!” his friend pleaded.Joey groaned, clutching the edge of the table. His eyes bulged, and for a moment, it looked like he was about to explode.RIIIIIIIIP—PING!The sound echoed through the room as Joey’s t-shirt tore clean down the middle, the Nathan’s logo splitting apart. PING! His pants button shot across the room like a bullet, ricocheting off a tray. His stomach surged forward, finally free from its confines.Joey slumped back into the booth, his belly wobbling with the sudden release. His head tilted back, his arms limp at his sides. He was completely out, slipping into a food coma. Eli stood, raising his arms in triumph. “YESSS!” he roared, basking in the stunned silence of the buffet. He turned to Joey’s unconscious form and smirked. “Pathetic eater,” he declared, loud enough for everyone to hear.The crowd erupted into murmurs, some laughing nervously, others shaking their heads in disbelief. David sighed, putting his face in his hands.“Eli,” David muttered, “you just had to make it a spectacle, didn’t you?”Eli grinned, grabbing a celebratory slice of pie. “What can I say? A win’s a win.”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The obese couple",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The waiter offers help",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidHurriedBack"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLingeredNearT":[["^Eli lingered near the mouth of the water slide, a playful smirk spreading across his face. The thrill of accidentally swallowing that girl sent a strange excitement through him. Now, curiosity got the better of him. Who else might come flying out? Moments later, the water gushed again, and another rider shot out of the tube—this time a boy on an inflatable ring. FWUMP! Gone in an instant. Eli chuckled, licking his lips. \"This is way too easy.\" And so it continued. One by one, shrieking riders zipped out of the slide, only to disappear straight into Eli’s eagerly waiting mouth. A teenager. Then a couple. Even a man trying to make a big splash. FWUMP. FWUMP. FWUMP. Eli’s belly swelled larger with each gulp, ballooning rapidly. It grew so massive that it sagged beneath the water, spreading out and weighing him down. Soon, his stomach was so big it began breaking the surface, wobbling like an oversized beach ball. He giggled softly, rubbing the taut dome of his belly. \"Okay… maybe this was a bit much...\" But his belly let out a deep, echoing groooaaaan, rippling through the water. From across the pool, David had just finished swimming laps when he spotted the massive, wobbling shape bobbing in the water. His eyes narrowed. \"Oh, for—\" David muttered under his breath and swam over, cutting through the water quickly. As he got closer, the full picture came into view: Eli’s belly was gigantic, round, and glossy, half-submerged and drawing stares from nearby swimmers. David’s jaw tightened. \"Eli. What. Did. You. Do.\" Eli’s face turned bright red. He splashed water toward David defensively. \"I-It was an accident!\" David crossed his arms. \"Another accident?\" \"I swear!\" Eli stammered, gripping the sides of his swollen belly. \"They just... kind of flew in! I couldn’t help it!\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You couldn’t help it? Eli, your stomach is practically a tourist attraction right now!\" Eli’s belly groaned again, sending a soft ripple through the pool. People nearby were starting to glance their way, whispering. David’s eyes darted around. \"Okay, we need to get you out of here. Now.\" Eli’s eyes widened in panic. \"David, I can't just waddle out with this thing! Everyone will stare!\" David cursed under his breath. He had a point. If Eli tried to get out now, his massive belly would draw even more attention. \"Okay, okay, think!\" David muttered. Eli gave his belly a tentative poke. \"What if… we go to the hot tub? The bubbles might help, you know… settle things.\" David gave him a flat look. \"You think a hot tub is going to fix this?\" Eli pouted. \"Or… I could try to digest a little. Maybe.\" David sighed heavily, weighing the options.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLingeredNearT.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Try the hot tub",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLingeredNearT.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Digest it",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLingeredNearT.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidHuffedAsHeC"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLingeredNearT.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidWatchedElis"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliSlowlyDrifted":[["^Eli slowly drifted away from the water slides, deciding it was safer to find a quieter spot. His eyes landed on a narrow, arched entrance tucked into the corner of the pool area. Soft, glowing lights shimmered from within, and the gentle hum of bubbling water echoed out.Curious, Eli floated toward it and slipped through the entrance, finding himself in a cozy artificial grotto. The walls mimicked rocky cave formations, with soft lighting casting warm reflections off the water. Along the edges, metallic grates on the pool floor released streams of bubbling water, creating built-in lounges for guests to relax.A few people were already reclined on the grates, enjoying the soothing jets. Eli grinned and carefully lowered himself onto one of the bubbling platforms.The moment he settled in, the jets roared to life beneath him, sending waves of bubbles rushing up against his massive, overstuffed belly. His bloated stomach jiggled and wobbled violently with every burst of air, the water rippling around it.The other guests slowly turned their heads. Eyes widened. Whispers began.\"Is that his stomach?\"\"How can someone even move with that thing?\"\"It’s like a giant balloon!\"Eli’s cheeks flushed bright red. He tried to relax, gently patting his belly as it bounced and shook with the bubbles. \"It's... just helping with digestion,\" he muttered under his breath.David leisurely finished his swim, enjoying the cool water and the peaceful atmosphere of the pool deck. Stretching out his arms, he took a deep breath and glanced around, expecting to spot Eli lounging somewhere or maybe splashing in the shallow end. But Eli was nowhere to be seen. David frowned. Where did he run off to now? He casually checked the snack bar—empty. The water slides—nothing. He even glanced toward the lounge chairs, but no sign of Eli. David sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Seriously? How does someone with a belly like that just disappear?\" As he scanned the pool area again, his eyes caught a dimly lit, cave-like tunnel tucked away in a corner of the pool. Soft, glowing lights shimmered from inside, and faint bubbling noises echoed out. David tilted his head. \"Huh.\" Curiosity got the better of him, and he swam toward the narrow entrance, slipping into the artificial grotto. The water grew warmer, and the sound of bubbling jets became louder. But as soon as David entered, he stopped dead in his tracks. Right in the middle of the grotto, half-submerged in the bubbling water, was a massive, round belly, stretched so tightly it glistened under the soft lights. It wobbled slightly with the jets of water beneath it, dominating the entire space. David's eyes widened in pure shock. \"What the...?\" Slowly, his eyes traveled upward, and there was Eli—face bright red, awkwardly rubbing his enormous, bloated stomach. David could barely form words. \"Eli. What. Happened.\" Eli froze, his hands pressed against the towering dome of his gut. \"I-I can explain!\" David raised an eyebrow, disbelief written all over his face. \"Oh, please do.\" Eli stammered, clearly panicked. \"I was just… relaxing! The bubbles felt nice, and… and one thing led to another and… I might have… accidentally…\" David narrowed his eyes. \"Accidentally what?\" Eli shrank back, clutching his belly. \"Accidentally… ate… some people.\" David stared at him in stunned silence, then slowly looked around the empty grotto. \"You’re kidding me.\" \"I-I didn’t mean to!\" Eli whined. \"I was just lying here, and people kept floating too close and—\" David groaned, dragging a hand down his face. \"Eli. You have to stop doing this!\" \"I tried!\" Eli protested, giving his stomach a helpless jiggle. David took a deep breath to stay calm and glanced at the narrow tunnel behind him. Then back at Eli’s enormous, wobbling belly. His face paled. \"You’re not going to fit through that.\" Eli blinked, glancing nervously at the small entrance. \"Wait… what?\" David gave him a deadpan look. \"That belly is not squeezing through that tunnel. You’re stuck here unless you… you know.\" Eli's face turned even redder. \"No! I hate doing that!\" David crossed his arms. \"Well, unless you want to stay here until someone drains the pool, you don’t have a choice.\" Eli groaned miserably, rubbing his taut belly. \"Ugh… fine! But I swear, I’m going to need so much more food after this!\" David rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just do it.\" Eli closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and with a soft grunt, his stomach slowly began to shrink. A deep gurgling noise echoed from within as his enormous belly gradually deflated, softening and pulling back toward a more manageable size. David watched with relief. \"There. Much better.\" Eli slumped forward, breathing heavily. \"That was awful...\" David smirked. \"Come on, let’s get out of here before someone notices.\" The two swam back through the narrow tunnel and emerged into the bustling pool area. Eli stretched, still looking drained but back to his normal size. After a moment, Eli perked up. \"Sooo… since I’m, uh, empty now… what if we hit up another buffet? Or maybe the cinema?\" David sighed, shaking his head with a smirk. \"Eli, you’re impossible.\" Eli grinned. \"Yeah, but you love it.\" David chuckled under his breath. \"Let’s go before you eat the entire ship.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Another buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The Movies",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSoftHumOfTheS"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBuffetHallWas2":[["^The buffet hall was a mess of empty plates, crumpled napkins, and the lingering scent of rich, heavy food. The obese couple who had been silently competing with Eli slumped back in their booth, utterly defeated. The man’s shirt was torn open, buttons scattered across the floor, and his belly heaved with labored breaths. His partner’s stretched dress was barely holding together, seams split along her sides. Eli, on the other hand, leaned back with a smug grin, his belly swollen and massive, sagging heavily between his legs and nearly touching the floor. From across the room, the young waiter had been watching the entire \"competition\" unfold, captivated by Eli’s relentless appetite. Slowly, he approached the booth, clutching his notepad more for comfort than necessity. “Wow,” the waiter breathed out, eyes wide with admiration. “That was… incredible. You completely destroyed them.” Eli smirked, rubbing his enormous belly. \"Yeah, I guess I did.\" The waiter chuckled nervously, glancing at Eli’s massive stomach before quickly looking away. \"You, uh… you really know how to put it away.\" He hesitated for a second, then softly added, \"Mind if I… help you out? Bring you more food, I mean. After a show like that, you deserve it.\" Eli raised a brow, noticing how the waiter’s hand lingered near his notepad. \"Sure, knock yourself out.\" The waiter’s face lit up, though a blush crept up his cheeks. Slowly, almost unconsciously, he reached out and let his hand gently brush against Eli’s stretched belly, fingers lightly gliding over the taut skin. \"You’re… amazing,\" the waiter murmured, his voice barely audible. Eli chuckled, leaning back a little more. \"Careful. Keep touching me like that, and I might end up eating you too.\" The waiter’s breath caught, and Eli didn’t miss how the front of his pants visibly tightened. The poor guy pulled his hand back quickly, stammering, \"S-sorry! I’ll, uh, I’ll go grab more food!\" Eli smirked as the waiter practically ran off. David returned just in time to catch the scene. He raised an eyebrow, noticing the waiter hurrying away. \"Making more friends, are we?\" Eli laughed. \"What can I say? People appreciate talent.\" David shook his head, dropping off more plates. \"Yeah, seems like he appreciates more than just that.\" Over the next hour, the waiter kept returning with tray after tray of food, completely ignoring other customers. He would linger for a few moments each time, shyly asking, \"Still got room?\" Eli would grin and proudly pat his belly. THWUMP. \"Plenty. I could probably fit the whole buffet in here.\" The waiter’s knees nearly buckled at that, his face flushing bright red. \"I-I believe it!\" He brought even more food, sneaking shy glances at Eli as he devoured plate after plate. Eventually, the waiter couldn’t help himself and leaned in closer. “How do you do it?” he asked, voice soft with awe. “How can you fit so much?” Eli smirked. \"Let’s just say I was born with a special kind of talent.\" He gave his belly a slow, deliberate rub. \"And I’m always hungry.\" The waiter swallowed hard, his eyes locked on Eli’s belly. Eli noticed the growing bulge in his pants again and chuckled to himself. By now, it was nearly midnight. David, half-asleep in the booth, rubbed his eyes. \"Eli, it’s getting late. Maybe we should wrap this up before you eat the entire kitchen.\" The waiter, exhausted but still pushing himself, shakily placed one last tray on the table. His movements were sluggish, his eyelids drooping. Eli raised an eyebrow. \"You okay there, buddy?\" \"I-I’m fine,\" the waiter mumbled, swaying slightly. He leaned forward, as if to steady himself, and before anyone could react, he slumped forward—landing face-first on Eli’s enormous belly. THUMP. David blinked, staring at the waiter now softly snoring on Eli’s gut. \"Well… looks like you broke him.\" Eli chuckled. \"Oops.\" David sighed. \"Alright, that’s it. You’re done for tonight.\" He gently shook the waiter’s shoulder. \"Hey, wake up.\" The waiter stirred, groaning softly. \"Huh? Oh… s-sorry...\" David smirked. \"Come on, help me get this lump back to the room.\" Together, David and the groggy waiter struggled to haul Eli out of the booth. Eli groaned, wobbling as they half-pushed, half-dragged him through the empty hallways. When they reached the cabin, David froze. \"Oh, for—Eli, you’re not fitting through that door.\" Eli stared at the narrow doorway. \"Uhh…\" David sighed. \"Alright, on three. One… two… three!\" They both shoved Eli forward, his massive belly squeezing through the frame. SCRRRTCH! POP! Eli toppled inside with a loud THUD. The waiter leaned against the wall, panting. \"Glad I could… help.\" David patted his shoulder. \"Yeah, thanks. Go get some sleep.\" The waiter managed a tired smile. \"Goodnight.\" He turned and staggered down the hall. David closed the door, looking at Eli sprawled out on the floor, belly rising and falling with each breath.

The air was thick with the smell of coffee and syrup. David strolled in looking refreshed, while Eli trailed beside him, back to his slim, empty self after deflating overnight. His eyes darted around the room, scanning the faces of the staff. \"Looking for someone?\" David asked casually. Eli shrugged, trying to sound indifferent. \"Just… wondering if that waiter from last night works here too.\" David smirked. \"Aw, missing your personal food delivery guy already?\" Eli rolled his eyes but didn’t deny it. \"Whatever. Guess he’s not here.\" Without wasting another second, Eli grabbed a tray and dove headfirst into the buffet. Piles of pancakes, sausages, eggs, and pastries quickly stacked up on his plate. David chuckled and followed him to a table, sipping his coffee as Eli tore into his food. \"So,\" David began, watching Eli inhale a stack of pancakes, \"I was thinking… maybe today we could do something that isn’t eating.\" Eli paused mid-bite and gave David a deadpan look. \"I could literally eat all day. Easily.\" David snorted. \"Yeah, no argument there. But maybe, just maybe, it wouldn’t hurt to pace yourself. You know, so there’s food left for the next three weeks.\" Eli huffed, cramming more eggs into his mouth. \"Sounds like a personal problem.\" David smirked. \"Okay, well, here’s a thought. After breakfast, we could go up to the sun deck, catch some rays. Or—\" he paused, grinning, \"we could hit the gym.\" Eli suddenly choked on a bite of bacon, coughing violently. David burst out laughing. \"Relax, I’m kidding! I’ll go alone if I have to.\" Eli shot him a glare, pounding his chest to clear his throat. \"Not funny.\" David leaned back, sipping his coffee. \"Come on, sun deck sounds nice.

The massive orb floated just beneath the surface, sloshing gently as David tried to steer it without drawing attention. \"Will you stop drifting off?\" David muttered, pushing Eli's belly back on course. \"I'm trying to get you to the hot tub, not let you float out to sea.\" Eli pouted, lazily paddling his arms. \"It’s not my fault! I’m like a balloon right now!\" Thankfully, the pool wasn’t too crowded, and the space was big enough for them to move without too many eyes on them. David scanned the area and spotted the large, elevated hot tub nestled in a corner, steam rising invitingly. \"There. That should help,\" David pointed. But as they approached, two problems became clear. First—the hot tub was raised, requiring them to climb a set of three small steps. Second—there was already someone in the hot tub. A heavier man lounged in the bubbling water, eyes closed and completely relaxed. Neither David nor Eli noticed him. David leaned in, lowering his voice. \"Okay, we need to be quick. No one’s looking. You need to get up those steps.\" Eli stared at the steps and then at his belly, which was too wide and heavy to move easily. \"Uh, David? Not happening.\" David groaned. \"Just grab the railing, and I’ll push.\" Eli sighed but reached for the metal handrail. David braced himself behind Eli, shoving with both hands under Eli's belly as Eli strained to pull himself up. \"Come on… just a little—\" With a wet, squelching sound, Eli’s enormous gut finally flopped out of the pool, smacking heavily onto the edge. Water splashed everywhere. David gave one final shove, and Eli managed to drag himself up the steps. Then, with a strained grunt, Eli heaved himself over the rim of the hot tub. KA-WHOOSH! An enormous wave of hot water erupted as Eli’s massive belly crashed into the bubbling water, sending a tidal wave over the edge. The blast of water hit the lounging man full force, launching him out of the hot tub with a startled yelp. “WHOA!” The man tumbled backward onto the pool deck, sputtering and soaked. Eli, oblivious, sighed contently as he settled into the now half-empty tub. His gigantic belly took up nearly all the space, wobbling and floating lazily in the remaining water. David climbed in beside him, carefully squeezing into what little space was left. \"Well… he needed to leave anyway.\" Eli closed his eyes, relaxing. \"Mmm… this feels so much better.\" For a few peaceful moments, the warm, bubbling water surrounded them. The heat seemed to soothe Eli’s overstuffed stomach. But then… something shifted. Blorp. Eli’s eyes fluttered open. \"Uh… David?\" David glanced at him. \"What now?\" Eli's belly gave another strange blorp and began to slowly expand, the surface wobbling unnaturally. The bubbling water churned more violently around him. David’s face paled. \"Oh no.\" The hot water seemed to be triggering something. Eli's belly began to rise higher, swelling larger with slow, ominous groans. Gllllrrrbbb… \"I think… I think the water’s making it worse!\" Eli yelped, gripping the sides of the tub as his stomach stretched tighter. David scrambled back, eyes wide. \"Okay, okay! Out! Get out now!\" Eli tried to move, but his belly was now pressing against the sides of the tub, wedged tightly. The bubbling jets only seemed to make it worse, gurgling and inflating him more. \"I—I can’t move!\" Eli panicked. David frantically looked around. \"Okay, you have to deflate! Now!\" Eli groaned, face red with effort. \"Ugh… I hate this!\" With a loud, echoing FFFFWOOOOOMP, Eli's belly started to shrink, sloshing and gurgling as it deflated. Water rushed back into the tub, splashing over the sides as the tension in his stomach slowly eased. Panting, Eli slumped back into the water. \"I… I think I’m good now.\" David wiped water off his face. \"Next time, we’re skipping the hot tub and going straight to the buffet.\" Eli, despite everything, grinned. \"Buffet sounds amazing right now!\" David groaned, dragging a hand down his face. \"Of course it does.

There’s no way we’re getting you out of here without drawing attention.\" Eli pouted, giving his massive belly a gentle pat. \"But I don’t want to! It took so much effort to get this full!\" David narrowed his eyes. \"Eli.\" Eli sighed dramatically. \"Fiiine. But only if we go to another buffet after this!\" David smirked. \"Deal.\" Reluctantly, Eli closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His stomach gave a deep, echoing grooooan before slowly starting to shrink. Blorp... Gllllrrrp... Little by little, the massive, stretched dome of his belly softened and deflated, the tension easing away. The water around them calmed as Eli’s body returned to its usual slim frame. Eli slumped forward, panting. \"Ugh… I hate doing that.\" David chuckled. \"Yeah, well, at least now you can fit through doors again.\" They climbed out of the pool and headed back to their cabin to change. Inside the cozy room, Eli flopped onto the bed, towel draped over his shoulders. His eyes drifted to the ceiling, and he muttered, \"I wonder how much food they actually have on this ship…\" David froze mid-step, staring at him. \"Eli.\" Eli sat up, thoughtful. \"No, seriously! I mean, it’s a huge cruise. Thousands of people. There must be literal tons of food somewhere!\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"This cruise is three weeks long. Three. Weeks. You don’t have to eat it all in the first two days.\" Eli grinned. \"I’m just saying, it’d be a shame to let it go to waste.\" David rolled his eyes. \"You are not eating the entire ship.\" Eli chuckled but then perked up. \"Sooo… what now? Buffet round two? Or maybe the cinema? I heard they’re playing some good movies.\" David paused, considering it. \"Do you actually want to watch a movie this time, or are you just thinking about the snacks?\" Eli grinned. \"Can’t it be both?\" David sighed, shaking his head with a smirk. \"Alright, your choice.

David sipped his coffee, watching him with an amused smirk. “So, are you going to stay here all day, or should we actually do something besides eating?” David asked. Eli paused, tapping his fork against his plate. \"Hmm... I guess we could go soak up some sun.\" David raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"Really?\" \"But,\" Eli added, holding up a finger, \"I need to eat something first. I mean, come on, I've only had a measly four trays so far!\" David sighed. \"Of course.\" Without wasting time, Eli grabbed two more trays and piled them high with pancakes, bacon, pastries, and fruit. He devoured them with ease, his belly starting to swell and round out, pushing against the edge of the table. By the time Eli was done, his stomach was noticeably bloated, stretching his shirt tight. He groaned contently, leaning back and rubbing his taut belly. \"Okay, now I’m ready.\" David rolled his eyes but stood up. \"Let’s go before you change your mind.\"They made their way to the elevator, Eli waddling slightly as his bloated belly swayed with every step. David pressed the button, and the doors slid open. They rode up to the top deck in silence, the gentle hum of the elevator broken only by Eli’s soft groans of fullness. When they stepped out onto the upper deck, a pleasant breeze greeted them. The morning sun was already warming the air, casting a golden glow over the vast, open ocean. Eli squinted behind his sunglasses, scanning the rows of lounge chairs. His eyes locked onto an extra-wide lounger, clearly designed for heavier passengers. \"Perfect,\" Eli muttered with a grin. He waddled over and flopped onto the oversized chair with a deep oof, causing it to creak under his weight. He adjusted himself, pulling his sunglasses into place and plopping a floppy sunhat on his head. David chuckled. \"Comfortable?\" Eli let out a long sigh. \"Very.\" David glanced at the railing overlooking the ocean. \"You don’t want to take a walk? Enjoy the view?\" Eli barely turned his head. \"It’s just water. Looks the same from here.\" David shook his head. \"Fine, I’ll go take a look.\"David strolled along the deck, enjoying the cool breeze and the endless expanse of the ocean. The sun glinted off the waves, and for a brief moment, he appreciated the peace. But when he returned to Eli, he stopped in his tracks. Eli hadn't moved—but now, beside his lounger was a small table stacked with three colorful cocktails, condensation dripping down the glasses. Resting on his massive belly was a tray piled high with snacks. David blinked. \"Seriously?\" Eli lazily turned his head. \"What? A waiter came by. What was I supposed to do—not order something?\" David rubbed his face. \"You were supposed to relax.\" Eli smirked and casually raised a hand, signaling to the waiter across the deck. The waiter gave a polite nod and hurried off. David sighed but said nothing, flopping down onto the lounger next to him. His muscles still ached from the gym, and the warmth of the sun lulled him into a slow, steady sleep.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^David wakes-up to huge Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^David wakes-up but Eli is gone",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT9":[["^Eli leaned back in the booth, already working through his second plate of breakfast.

Go lift something heavy. I’ll be right here.\" David rolled his eyes, grabbed his room key, and headed out.After a quick change in their cabin, David found himself in one of the ship’s luxurious fitness centers. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a breathtaking view of the endless ocean. The gym was sleek and modern, filled with the quiet hum of treadmills and the soft clang of weights. David got to work, pushing himself hard for a solid hour. Sweat dripped down his face as he powered through sets, muscles burning. By the time he was finished, he felt completely spent but satisfied. After a refreshing shower, David threw on clean clothes and made his way back to the buffet.As David approached the booth where he had left Eli, he frowned. It was empty. \"Huh.\" David glanced around. Maybe he went back to the cabin? But then—THWUMP. THWUMP. A deep, echoing sound caught David's attention, followed by loud, high-pitched laughter. He knew that sound all too well. David followed the noise around the corner, and what he saw made him stop dead in his tracks. Eli was wedged into a larger booth, his belly massively swollen again, stretched so tight it pushed against the edge of the table. On either side of him sat two young waitresses, both laughing hysterically as they shoved stacks of powdered donuts into Eli’s mouth. One of them leaned in, giggling, \"Come on, open up! There’s still more!\" Eli obediently opened wide, cheeks bulging as another donut disappeared. His bloated stomach gave a deep, satisfied groan, and he instinctively patted it with both hands, causing a deep THWUMP that echoed off the walls. The girls cackled even harder, practically falling over each other. David stared, blinking slowly. \"Oh, for God's sake.\" Eli glanced up, locking eyes with David. His expression was pure guilt, his eyes wide and desperate as if saying, I swear, this isn’t my fault! David raised an eyebrow. The two waitresses finally noticed David standing there. One of them gave him an obvious once-over, smirking. \"Oh wow, look at you! Someone’s been using the gym.\" The other giggled. \"You should’ve joined us! We were just having a little fun!\" David gave them a flat look. \"Yeah, I can see that.\" One of the girls patted Eli’s massive belly affectionately. \"Sadly, we have to get back to work.\" She winked at Eli. \"Try not to pop, okay?\" The other leaned in closer. \"Come find us later if you want more…\" With that, both waitresses giggled and waved as they sauntered off, leaving Eli slouched in the booth, belly heaving with each breath. David slowly turned back to Eli, crossing his arms. \"So… care to explain?\" Eli groaned, giving his belly a weak pat. \"I didn’t do anything! They just… came over, started touching my belly, and next thing I knew, they were feeding me trays of donuts!\" David stared for a long moment before sighing. \"Of course they did.\" Eli gave a sheepish grin. \"I couldn’t exactly stop them, could I?\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You’re impossible.\" He glanced at the clock on the wall. \"So… you want to go catch some sun on the upper deck, or do you have more accidents planned?\" Eli rubbed his enormous belly thoughtfully. \"Hmm… the sun does sound nice, but the buffet isn’t going to eat itself.\" David smirked. \"Pick one.

He stretched with a groan, feeling the warmth of the sun on his skin. Blinking against the bright light, he turned to glance at Eli. David froze. Eli was still on his oversized lounger—but now his belly had ballooned into a massive, round dome, wobbling slightly with every breath. His bloated gut stretched so wide it spilled over the sides of the lounger, his shirt long since ridden up to expose the taut, shiny skin of his stomach. Empty cocktail glasses were piled high on the small table next to him, and Eli was holding another colorful drink in one hand while lazily stuffing pastries into his mouth with the other. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes glassy. David’s eyes narrowed. \"Oh no.\" Eli took a long, sloppy sip of his drink and waved the empty glass in the air. \"Hey! More!\" he slurred, pointing at a nearby waiter. \"Faster! And bring me—hic—everything!\" The young waiter, looking nervous, quickly turned to fetch more. Around them, other guests lounging nearby began to whisper and stare. \"Is he still eating?\" \"How is that even possible?\" \"Doesn’t he ever stop?\" A grumpy man sitting a few chairs away muttered loudly, \"At this rate, that pig's gonna eat the whole buffet! What are we supposed to eat?\" Eli’s half-lidded eyes snapped in his direction. He slowly turned his head, glaring. \"Be glad I don’t eat you, buddy,\" Eli growled darkly, his voice low and rumbling. The man paled and looked away, muttering under his breath. David finally sat up, running a hand over his face. \"Eli, seriously?\" But Eli didn’t respond. He was too busy guzzling another drink, the liquid spilling slightly down his chin. His free hand was already reaching for another tray of food. Then— CRACK. David’s head shot up. \"Oh no.\" CRRRRACK— With a sharp SNAP, the frame of Eli’s oversized lounger gave way under the immense weight. CRASH! Eli let out a surprised grunt as the chair collapsed beneath him, sending him tumbling onto the deck in a heap of wobbling belly and limbs. His enormous stomach jiggled violently from the impact. For a moment, there was silence. Then the deck erupted in laughter. Guests around them burst into loud, mocking laughter, some pointing, others openly giggling. One man snorted, \"Guess they need industrial strength furniture for him!\" David grimaced. Eli, still sprawled out on the deck, turned beet red. His fists clenched at his sides, and his bloated belly heaved with every furious breath. His eyes darted around the laughing crowd, seething. He shakily pointed a finger at them, his hand trembling with anger. \"You’ll all regret this,\" he snarled through gritted teeth. The laughter only grew louder. Without another word, Eli struggled to his feet, gripping the nearby railing for support. His enormous belly swayed heavily as he stomped toward the elevator. David jumped up. \"Eli, wait—!\" But Eli didn’t stop. He slammed the elevator button with his fist, and when the doors opened, he squeezed his massive body inside, glaring at anyone who looked his way. The doors closed with a soft ding, and Eli was gone. David cursed under his breath. \"Damn it.\" Not wasting another second, he bolted for the next elevator, jamming the button repeatedly. \"Come on, come on!\" As soon as the doors opened, David rushed inside, hitting the button for the lower deck. \"What the hell is he up to now?\" David muttered, staring at the elevator doors as they slid shut.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli gets furious",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli just goes to calm down nerves",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliStormedThroug"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theWarmSunBathed":[["^The warm sun bathed the upper deck as David slowly stirred awake. He stretched, blinking against the light, feeling the soreness in his muscles from the gym. But something felt… off. He turned to the lounge chair beside him. Empty. Eli was gone. David sat up, frowning. The small table next to Eli’s lounger was piled high with empty cocktail glasses, their colorful straws sticking out at odd angles, and a mountain of empty snack plates. David sighed, rubbing his face. \"Of course.\" He stood up and scanned the deck, but Eli was nowhere in sight. David spotted a nearby waiter wiping down a table and approached him. “Hey, did you see where my friend went? The guy who was here—kinda hard to miss, big appetite?” The waiter chuckled knowingly. “Oh, yeah. I saw him take the elevator down about twenty minutes ago.” David raised an eyebrow. “Did he say where he was going?” The waiter tapped his chin. “Hmm… I think right before that, they made an announcement about a magic show happening in one of the theaters. Maybe he went to check that out?” David sighed, already putting the pieces together. “Yeah, that sounds about right. Thanks.” Without another word, he made his way toward the elevators.The theater was buzzing with excitement. The large hall was packed, mostly with families and excited kids eagerly waiting for the magic show to begin. The lights dimmed, and soft music played over the speakers. David slipped into the back, scanning the crowd. No sign of Eli. He carefully moved down the aisle, glancing between the rows. Still nothing. But then—out of the corner of his eye—he caught a glimpse. Near the side of the stage, Eli was trying to slip behind a curtain, disappearing into the backstage area. David narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, for the love of—\" He started moving toward the side entrance, but suddenly, the lights in the theater went out completely. DUN DUN DUNNNN! Dramatic music filled the room, and a spotlight snapped onto the stage. The magician, dressed in a shimmering black suit with a tall hat, raised his hands high. “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, prepare yourselves for a feat beyond imagination! I will now make my two assistants... disappear!” The crowd cheered. David groaned and sank into an empty seat. \"Here we go.\" On stage, two smiling assistants—a man and a woman—stepped into a large, ornate wooden cabinet. The magician closed the doors with a theatrical flourish and began spinning the cabinet slowly, showing it off from all angles. He circled the box dramatically, waving his hands and muttering in exaggerated tones. Then— GLLLUUUUURP. A deep, muffled swallowing sound echoed faintly through the stage speakers. The magician paused for half a second, blinking in confusion. David, sitting in the darkened theater, smirked to himself. \"Yep.\" But the magician quickly regained his composure, pretending it was all part of the act. With a final wave of his hands, he flung the cabinet doors open. Empty. The crowd erupted into applause and cheers, children squealing with excitement. The magician bowed deeply, hiding his brief look of confusion. Backstage, in the shadows beneath the stage, Eli quietly emerged from behind a curtain. His shirt was strained to its limit, stretched tightly over his now massively bloated belly, which shifted and wobbled with every step. He clutched his enormous gut, moving carefully through the darkness, the sounds of faint muffled protests coming from deep within. David, watching from the back, stood up and smirked, shaking his head.David quietly followed Eli through the dimly lit hallway behind the theater, watching him waddle ahead with his enormous, gurgling belly shifting with every step. The muffled sounds of movement and faint protests came from deep inside Eli's stomach, making it wobble slightly. David shook his head in disbelief. \"Eli, seriously?\" Eli glanced over his shoulder, giving David a sheepish grin. He patted his massive, round gut with both hands, making it jiggle. \"What? They were supposed to disappear, right? So technically... nothing happened!\" David stopped in his tracks, staring at him. \"You ate the magician's assistants!\" Eli waved a hand dismissively. \"Pfft, it’s called method acting, David. I just made the trick more... believable.\" David rubbed his forehead. \"You’re unbelievable. You know he’s probably freaking out backstage right now.\" Eli grinned smugly. \"Hey, I made his act unforgettable. Those kids loved it!\" David gave him a long, hard look. \"You’re lucky they didn’t check the box for crumbs.\" Eli chuckled and gave his belly a playful slap. THWUMP. \"Relax. They’ll turn up in a few hours… give or take.\" David groaned. \"You’re impossible.\" Eli smirked. \"And yet, here you are, still following me.\" David sighed deeply, shaking his head. \"Let’s just get you out of here before you decide to make the magician disappear too.\" Eli chuckled, slowly waddling ahead. \"No promises!\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for some \"fun\" to cabin",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for lunch",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theHallwayOfTheC"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliShotHimALazyG":[["^Eli shot him a lazy glare. \"Yeah, yeah.

His massive belly rounded out in front of him, catching the full glare of the sun.David smirked. \"You sure you don’t want to walk around a bit? Maybe check out the view?\"Eli didn’t even look at him. \"It’s just water, David. Seen one wave, seen them all.\"David shook his head with a chuckle. \"Suit yourself.\"As David wandered off to explore the deck and later took a refreshing swim in the pool, Eli drifted into a deep, heavy sleep. His massive belly rose and fell slowly in the sunlight. --- <em>An Hour Later</em> --- David returned, drying off his hair with a towel. But from a distance, something didn’t look right.\"Ha,ha.\" Eli was still fast asleep, but his enormous belly—completely exposed—was now turning a bright, angry shade of red. The stretched skin glistened under the harsh midday sun.David chuckled under his breath and walked over.\"Hey, sunbather!\" David leaned down and shook Eli’s shoulder. \"Wake up!\"Eli stirred, blinking under his sunglasses. \"Mmmh... what?\"David grinned. \"You might want to check your belly.\"Eli slowly looked down. His eyes widened. \"Oh no!\"He immediately started whining. \"Daaavid! My belly’s all burned!\" He pouted, gingerly patting the hot, reddened skin. \"It hurts!\"David burst out laughing. \"I told you to move!\"\"Don’t laugh!\" Eli whined louder, shifting uncomfortably. \"Do something!\"David rolled his eyes. \"Alright, alright.\" He waved over a passing waiter. \"*Hey, can we get... a lot of sunscreen? Like, a lot.\"The waiter blinked in confusion but nodded and hurried off.Moments later, the waiter returned with several large bottles of aloe lotion and sunscreen.David popped the cap open and squeezed a generous amount into his hand. \"Hold still.\"Eli pouted but leaned back. \"Be gentle!\"David smirked and began rubbing the cool lotion onto Eli’s massive, sunburned belly. The skin made a soft, sticky sound under his hands.\"Ahhh,\" Eli sighed in relief, eyes fluttering shut.The waiter awkwardly hovered nearby.David glanced at him. \"Come on, help out. There’s a lot of surface area here.\"The waiter’s face turned bright red. \"I—I… okay.\"He hesitantly reached out, his hands trembling as he carefully massaged lotion into the side of Eli's swollen stomach.Eli groaned as David and the awkward waiter carefully massaged cool aloe lotion over his massive, sunburned belly. His skin, now an angry shade of red, glistened under the sunlight as Eli melted into the lounge chair.\"Mmm... better,\" Eli sighed, closing his eyes in relief. \"But I think I deserve something for all this suffering.\"David shot him a flat look. \"You’re lucky we didn’t have to call the ship's medic.\"Eli smirked, giving his enormous belly a slow, content pat. \"Yeah, yeah… but what now?\"David raised an eyebrow, wiping his hands on a towel. \"Well, what do you want to do?\"Eli grinned lazily, his eyes glinting behind his sunglasses.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for lunch",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to the cabin to \"relax\"",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLoungedInHisB":[["^Eli lounged in his booth, lazily devouring stacks of pancakes and bacon, his belly already swollen from the waitresses' earlier pampering. His gut pressed heavily against the table, rising and falling with each slow, satisfied breath. Then the air seemed to shift. The buffet doors slammed open with a thunderous BANG. In stomped a mountain of a man. Easily over 500 pounds, his bulk strained every inch of his too-tight clothing. His stretched-out t-shirt clung to his massive, sweat-slicked chest, barely covering his enormous, pale gut that hung far over the waistband of his pants. Thick suspenders strained to hold up his sagging, overfilled trousers. His meaty fists clenched and unclenched as his small, predatory eyes locked onto the buffet. Without a word, he stomped forward, each step causing his belly to quake and jiggle heavily. \"Move!\" he barked at a waiter who scrambled out of his way. The man seized a tray in his thick hands and began piling it high—plates of greasy sausages, mountains of scrambled eggs, pancakes drowned in syrup, and slabs of dripping meat. Food teetered dangerously on the edge of the tray, but he didn't care. He dropped into the booth directly beside Eli with a heavy, chair-creaking THUMP. Without so much as a glance, he leaned in and began devouring everything in front of him. He didn’t use utensils. Forks and knives were too slow. He clawed at the food with thick, sausage-like fingers, stuffing handfuls of greasy bacon and syrup-soaked pancakes into his mouth. Bits of food sprayed from his lips as he barely chewed, swallowing in loud, wet gulps. GLRK. GLRK. His throat worked overtime, forcing food down as grease dripped from his chin onto the table. Eli watched him from the corner of his eye. The man paused for a moment, noticing Eli’s swollen belly. He slowly turned his head, eyes narrowing. Their eyes locked. A brief, tense silence. Then the man smirked, letting out a low, guttural chuckle. Without breaking eye contact, he raised a fist and snapped his fingers. \"MORE!\" he growled. \"Keep it coming!\" A waiter hurried off in a panic. Eli’s eyes darkened. His smirk slowly spread across his face. Challenge accepted. Without a word, Eli rose from his seat, his own bloated belly wobbling with each step. He grabbed two trays and loaded them higher than before—every kind of food he could find. He sauntered back to his booth, passing so close to the man that his belly nearly brushed against the other’s table. The man’s smirk faded slightly. Eli sat down, leaned in, and began to devour.For the next hour, the two titans ate with terrifying determination. Plates shattered. Food vanished. The buffet staff worked in a panic to refill the serving stations as fast as possible. Eli’s belly grew rapidly, swelling larger with every bite. It ballooned outward, pushing against the table and slowly spreading onto the floor. The tight fabric of his shirt creaked ominously, struggling to contain the sheer mass of his stomach. But the other man wasn’t far behind. His belly expanded grotesquely, rounding out so far it pinned him between the booth and the table. His suspenders strained, biting into his thick shoulders. His face dripped with sweat, but he kept going, grabbing fistfuls of mashed food and cramming it into his mouth. GLRK. GLRK. The wet, choking gulps echoed louder now. His face turned redder, his breathing heavier. But he refused to stop. The buffet had fallen silent. Guests stared in shock, unable to look away. The man’s pace began to falter. His hands, once ravenous and wild, now trembled as he grabbed another greasy sausage. His massive gut gurgled loudly, sending deep, unsettling sounds through the air. GROOOOOOOAN. But still, he pushed on, stuffing a disgusting, half-mashed mix of food into his mouth with trembling fingers. The food barely fit. His throat struggled to swallow. GLK… gghk… GLK. His eyes began to glaze over. His stomach lurched and shifted beneath his tight shirt, stretched so thin it looked ready to burst. Eli, still eating steadily, leaned back, his own enormous belly rising triumphantly in front of him. He casually lifted a buttery croissant and took a slow, exaggerated bite, locking eyes with his opponent. The man froze, his entire body trembling. He let out a choked grunt, and his fat hands dropped the remaining food onto his plate. His bloated stomach let out a deep, angry GRRROOOAAAN in protest. \"Ngh...\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Fat man accepts defeat",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Fat man's greed",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliStormedThroug":[["^Eli stormed through the ship's corridors, fists clenched, his face still burning with humiliation. The laughter from the sun deck echoed in his mind, fueling his rage.They think they can laugh at me? he thought bitterly. I’ll show them. I’ll show them all.He pushed through the double doors of the first buffet he could find—The Ocean Pearl Buffet—and the overwhelming scent of fresh bread, sizzling meats, and sweet desserts hit him like a wave.Eli’s eyes burned with determination.Without hesitation, he grabbed a tray and started piling it high—meats, pasta, pastries, anything he could get his hands on. He found an empty table, slammed the tray down, and began shoveling food into his mouth, barely chewing.\"They think they can laugh at me?\" Eli growled under his breath, crumbs flying. \"I’ll show them who’s funny.\"Plate after plate vanished. His belly swelled rapidly, pushing out against his shirt until it rode high, revealing his stretched skin. But Eli didn’t care.He was a machine now—shoving food into his mouth, gulping it down, demanding more.His stomach groaned and sloshed as it grew larger, resting heavily on his lap, then sliding down between his legs, spreading across the floor.Meanwhile, David was frantically searching the ship. He checked the sun deck, the theaters, even the pool areas—but Eli was nowhere to be found.His calls went straight to voicemail.“Come on, Eli, pick up!” David muttered, gripping his phone.The ship was massive, and there were countless places Eli could have disappeared to.David jogged down another corridor, scanning every door he passed.Then—DING.The ship's intercom crackled to life.“Attention: Security, please report to the Ocean Pearl Buffet immediately. Security to the Ocean Pearl Buffet.”David’s stomach dropped.\"Oh no.\"He broke into a sprint.When David burst through the buffet doors, chaos greeted him.Guests were backing away in shock, some filming with their phones, others yelling. Plates and trays were scattered everywhere.In the middle of it all was Eli.Or rather—Eli's massive belly, now swollen to an absurd size, dominating the center of the room. His gut spread across multiple tables, knocking over chairs, plates, and food trays.Eli was hunched over what remained of the buffet, shoveling food into his mouth like a wild animal, completely oblivious to the horrified stares around him.David’s jaw dropped. \"Oh my God.\"\"Eli!\" David pushed through the crowd. \"Eli, stop! You’re scaring people!\"Eli didn’t even look up. His face was buried in another tray of food, crumbs sticking to his cheeks. His belly gurgled loudly, expanding with each gulp.\"Eli!\"Nothing.Two security guards cautiously approached from the side, hands raised.\"Sir, you need to stop eating and come with us—\"\"RRRRGHH!\"Eli growled, his eyes wild. His belly groaned and sloshed as he crammed more food into himself.The guards hesitated, exchanging nervous glances.David stepped closer. \"Eli, you’re going to hurt yourself!\"Finally, Eli paused. Slowly, he turned his head, glaring at the crowd. His bloated stomach rose and fell with heavy breaths.He lifted a trembling hand and pointed a sausage-greased finger at the onlookers.\"None of you will laugh at me again!\" he snarled. \"Keep it up, and you’ll all end up in here too!\"Gasps rippled through the crowd.

David walked slowly beside Eli, his eyes glued to the enormous, rounded belly swaying with each step Eli took. Eli’s hoodie clung to his sides, riding up slightly to reveal the stretched, smooth skin of his stomach. But what held David’s attention wasn’t just Eli’s size—it was the subtle, almost imperceptible movements beneath the surface. The two magician’s assistants Eli had swallowed earlier shifted faintly inside him, causing small ripples to travel across his belly. David swallowed hard, his hands unconsciously reaching out to press gently against the side of Eli’s belly. Eli glanced sideways, smirking. “Can’t keep your hands off me, huh?” David chuckled breathlessly, fingers tracing slow circles over Eli’s taut skin. “How could I? You’re… incredible.” Eli’s belly gave a soft, low gurgle, followed by another faint shift inside. David felt the motion under his palms and shivered. “They’re still moving.” Eli’s smirk deepened. “Guess they’re still trying to figure out the trick.” David bit his lip, his breath quickening. The heat pooling in his chest was impossible to ignore. “We need to… do something about this,” David muttered, his voice rougher than he intended. Eli raised a brow, amused. “Yeah? What did you have in mind?” David grabbed Eli’s wrist, pulling him gently but firmly. “Cabin. Now.” Eli chuckled low in his throat. “Didn’t think you’d ask.” They shuffled quickly down the corridor, Eli’s massive belly swaying with every step, soft creaks of the floor echoing beneath their feet. Once inside the cabin, David didn’t waste time. He pushed the door shut and turned to face Eli, eyes dark with need. “Bed. Now.” Eli laughed, allowing David to guide him backward until the backs of his knees hit the mattress. He let himself fall heavily onto the bed, belly rising like a taut mountain between them. David knelt beside him, hands roaming hungrily over Eli’s stretched skin. The faint movements beneath made his breath catch—another subtle shift, a soft groan from deep inside Eli’s stomach. “They’re still squirming in there,” David whispered, voice trembling. Eli hummed, patting his belly. “They’re not going anywhere.” David leaned down, placing slow, deliberate kisses along the tight curve of Eli’s belly. Eli groaned softly, arching into the touch. David’s hands slid lower, hooking into the waistband of Eli’s strained shorts. He tugged them down slowly, exposing the soft curve of Eli’s hips and the tight bulge in his boxers. “Let me help you with this,” David murmured, dragging Eli’s boxers down. Eli’s breath hitched as David leaned in, taking him fully into his mouth. Slowly. Thoroughly. Eli groaned louder, hands gripping the sheets as David worked him over, not stopping until Eli trembled beneath him. David swallowed everything without hesitation, pulling back only when Eli’s breath evened out. But David wasn’t finished. He stood briefly, pushing his own shorts down, freeing himself. He climbed over Eli, gripping Eli’s massive belly for balance. Eli watched him with heavy-lidded eyes, smirking lazily. “Still hungry?” David didn’t answer. Instead, he pressed himself against Eli’s belly, grinding slowly as heat built between them. Eli’s belly shifted again, faintly, reminding them both of what still lingered inside. The feeling only pushed David further. His body tensed, and he let go, spilling across Eli’s swollen belly, groaning as he collapsed beside him. They lay together, panting softly, the cabin filled with the scent of sweat and satisfaction. David ran his hand slowly over Eli’s belly, smearing the mess across his skin. Eli chuckled lowly. “You’re just as messy as I am.” David laughed softly, resting his head on Eli’s shoulder. “Worth it.” A long silence stretched between them before David spoke again. “So… drinks at the club later? Or… another buffet?”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theHallwayOfTheC.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Lunch buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theHallwayOfTheC.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Evening club",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theHallwayOfTheC.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theHallwayOfTheC.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.thePulsingBeatOf"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theElevatorDoors":[["^The elevator doors slid shut with a dull thud, and Eli stood there, breathing heavily, his fists clenched at his sides. His massive belly jutted out in front of him, still wobbling slightly from the humiliating fall he’d just endured on the sun deck. They laughed at me. The memory of the mocking laughter, the stares, and the sound of the sun chair snapping beneath him burned in his mind. They think it’s funny? They think I’m funny? His face twisted in anger, and his chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. Then— GRRRROOOOWWWL. His stomach let out a deep, angry growl, vibrating through the small elevator. Eli blinked, looking down at his belly. \"Oh, great,\" he muttered. \"Now I’m starving too.\" For a moment, his mind swirled with thoughts of revenge. Maybe he could show them not to laugh at him. Maybe he could... But then another deep gurgle shook his gut, demanding his attention. He sighed, rolling his eyes. \"Forget it. Food first. They’re not worth it.\" A wicked smirk crept across his face. \"But lunch definitely is.\" The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. Eli waddled forward, his bloated belly swaying heavily with each step as he followed the familiar scent of food. Moments later, Eli shoved open the doors to the Seabreeze Feast Hall. It was quieter than the other buffets, tucked away at the far end of the ship, with panoramic windows showcasing the endless ocean. Elegant displays of food stretched across the room, untouched and perfectly arranged. Eli’s eyes glinted with excitement. \"Oh yeah… this’ll do.\" He grabbed two trays and wasted no time stacking them high—mountains of roasted meats, creamy pastas, buttery rolls, and rich desserts. Plates teetered dangerously as he carried the overloaded trays to a booth. He slumped down with a heavy WHUMP, the booth creaking under his weight, and immediately began devouring everything in sight. GLRK. MMFF. GULP. His belly groaned loudly as it swelled larger, pushing against the edge of the table. Meanwhile, David was pacing the ship, frustration mounting. \"Where the hell did he go?\" David muttered under his breath, checking his phone for the tenth time. Eli still wasn’t answering. David scowled. \"Fine. I’ll check every damn buffet on this ship if I have to.\" He stomped off, determination in his stride. Back in the buffet, Eli was lost in his feast when a light tap landed on his shoulder. \"Huh?\" Eli turned, ready to snap, but stopped. Standing there was Ryan—the young waiter from the previous day. \"Hey!\" Eli’s face lit up. \"Didn’t expect to see you again.\" Ryan chuckled nervously, glancing at the towering plates of food. \"Yeah, hard to miss you.\" Eli leaned back, giving his belly a proud pat. \"You should’ve seen the way they treated me on the sun deck. Laughing at me like a bunch of idiots.\" Ryan’s expression darkened. \"That’s awful. People can be so cruel.\" Eli grumbled, grabbing another fistful of food. \"Tell me about it.\" Ryan hesitated for a second, then his lips curled into a shy smile. \"You know… I’m off today, but if you want, I could help you out again. Bring you whatever you need.\" Eli blinked, then grinned widely. \"Seriously?\" \"Seriously,\" Ryan nodded. \"Anything you want.\" \"Man, you’re the best,\" Eli chuckled. \"Let’s do it.\" Ryan rushed off, returning moments later with towering trays of food. This time, he didn’t even bother setting them down. \"Open up,\" Ryan grinned. Eli smirked and obeyed. Ryan eagerly began feeding Eli directly—shoving in mouthfuls of food, barely giving him time to swallow. At one point, Eli leaned forward and swallowed an entire plate along with the food, the crunch of ceramic audible. Ryan froze for a moment, eyes wide, then let out a soft, breathless laugh. \"That’s… that’s insane.\" Eli licked his lips. \"Keep it coming.\"David stormed through hallway after hallway, buffet after buffet, but no Eli. His frustration deepened until he turned into a quiet corridor—and stopped. On the wall ahead, framed under glass, were missing person posters. David’s blood ran cold. Pictures of smiling passengers, each with the word MISSING in bold letters. David’s eyes scanned the faces—and his stomach dropped. The couple from the water slides. The magician’s assistants. Random guests he barely noticed before. All people Eli had casually eaten. David's hands clenched at his sides. \"Oh no...\" He didn’t waste another second.David burst into the Seabreeze Feast Hall, his eyes scanning the room. And there—sprawled out in a booth, his belly now enormous—was Eli. Ryan stood beside him, gleefully stuffing more food into Eli’s mouth. David froze, wide-eyed. \"*Oh, come on!\" Eli spotted him and lazily lifted a sticky hand. \"Hey, David!\" David stormed over, eyes flicking between Eli and Ryan. \"Are you kidding me?!\" \"Relax,\" Eli chuckled. \"Ryan’s just helping out.\" Ryan grinned sheepishly. \"Hey.\" David leaned in, lowering his voice. \"I just saw a wall of missing passengers. All people you’ve... eaten.\" Eli smirked. \"No one’s connecting that to me.\" David’s eyes narrowed. \"I’m not so sure. We need to go. Now.\" Eli groaned, leaning back. \"Oh, come on—\" \"Room service,\" David cut him off. \"All you can eat. No eyes on us.\" Ryan’s face lit up. \"I could help!\" Eli paused. \"Alright. But you’re both carrying me if I can’t move.\" David sighed. \"Let’s go before this turns into a crime scene.\" And with that, the three of them headed toward the elevators—David cautious, Ryan eager, and Eli ready for round two.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Private all-you-can-eat",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theCabinDoorClic"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theGrandBuffetHa":[["^The grand buffet hall was buzzing with the midday lunch crowd. The air was thick with the rich aroma of roasted meats, fresh bread, and sweet desserts. In the center of it all, Eli and David stepped into the vibrant Golden Horizon Buffet, a massive dining area adorned with elegant food displays. Eli’s eyes immediately locked onto a large, elaborate carving table near the entrance. Stunning sculptures made from watermelons, pumpkins, pineapples, and various other fruits and vegetables stood proudly on display. There were intricately carved flowers, animals, and even a miniature ship made entirely out of melon rinds and carved squash. \"Whoa,\" Eli breathed, practically drooling. David followed his gaze and smirked. \"Don’t even think about it. That’s decorative.\" Eli pouted, tearing his eyes away. \"Yeah, yeah…\" His stomach let out a low groooowl of protest. \"Fine.\" They made their way to the main food stations, and Eli wasted no time piling his tray high with every dish he could reach. He practically inhaled plate after plate of rich meats, pasta, and buttery sides, his belly swelling steadily. But as he ate, his eyes kept flicking back to the carving table. He licked his lips absentmindedly. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed something even more tempting—a second carving station on the other side of the buffet. This one wasn’t decorative. It was piled high with freshly roasted meats: a whole roasted pig, glazed ham on the bone, and thick cuts of smoked brisket. Eli’s pupils dilated. \"Stay calm,\" he whispered to himself, shoveling more food into his mouth. \"Stay focused.\" But the temptation gnawed at him. His stomach gave a deep, eager gurgle. \"Be right back,\" David said suddenly, standing up. \"Gonna hit the restroom. Try not to eat the table.\" \"No promises,\" Eli muttered, eyes still locked on the fruit sculptures. As soon as David disappeared into the crowd, Eli slowly pushed himself up, his bloated belly wobbling. He waddled toward the carving table, licking his lips. An elderly woman was standing nearby, admiring the delicate fruit sculptures. \"*Oh, aren’t these just lovely?\" she cooed. \"Must have taken hours to make!\" Eli stood beside her, breathing heavily, his eyes fixed on a giant watermelon carved into a blooming flower. His stomach growled loudly. The woman glanced at him with a polite smile. \"Oh, dear, are you hungry? You know, this isn’t for—\" GULP. Eli leaned forward and, without hesitation, grabbed the watermelon with both hands and shoved it into his mouth. His throat bulged grotesquely as the entire fruit slid down in one monstrous swallow. The woman gasped, clutching her pearls. \"Oh my heavens!\" But Eli didn’t stop. His eyes glazed over as he grabbed a towering pineapple sculpture and gulped it down, followed by an intricately carved pumpkin. \"No! That’s not for—!\" the woman shrieked, backing away in shock. Eli groaned in pleasure, hands moving faster. One by one, he devoured every single decorative piece—melons, gourds, pineapples, and even the squash carved into tiny flowers. Within moments, the entire display was gone. The woman stood frozen, staring in horror at the empty table. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Beautiful,\" he muttered, patting his now even larger belly. But he wasn’t done. He turned and waddled over to the other carving station. The carving chef barely had time to react before Eli lunged forward. \"Hey! Sir, please—!\" GULP. The entire glazed ham vanished into Eli’s mouth with a sickening slurp. GULP. The roasted pig followed, its crisped skin cracking as it slid down his throat. \"Oh my god!\" someone shouted. Eli leaned over and grabbed two massive turkey legs, crunching them bones and all. The carving chef stood paralyzed, knife dangling in his hand. Satisfied, Eli let out a heavy sigh, rubbing his belly that now sagged low, dragging against his knees. \"Perfect,\" he mumbled and waddled back to his booth just as David returned, wiping his hands on a napkin. \"What did I miss?\" David asked casually. Eli grinned, reclining in the booth and giving his massive belly a proud pat. \"Oh, nothing. Just enjoying lunch.\" But David paused, his eyes narrowing. Something felt… off. He glanced around. The once-grand fruit carving table? Completely empty. Not even a slice of melon remained. The meat carving station? Devastated. No pig. No ham. Just an empty platter and a horrified chef. David slowly turned back to Eli. \"What… did you do?\" Eli smirked. \"Guess they need better security.\" David rubbed his face in disbelief. \"Unbelievable.\" \"Come on,\" Eli chuckled, stretching with effort. \"Let’s hit another buffet. This one’s kinda empty now.\" David groaned.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The storm is coming",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theElevatorDoors1":["^The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime, just steps away from the sun deck.

David squeezed in beside him, the confined space forcing him to press against Eli’s taut, warm belly. Eli’s eyes flicked downward, a slow smirk spreading across his lips. “Something poking me, or is the elevator just this tight?” Eli teased, his voice smooth and low. David flushed, feeling the growing tightness in his own shorts, now firmly pressed into Eli’s firm stomach. “Not my fault you take up half the elevator,” David muttered, but there was no hiding the heat in his voice.

Moments later, the doors opened with another soft chime.","\n",{"->":".^.^.DavidLedEliDownT"},{"#f":1}],"TheMassiveManSat":[["^The massive man sat slumped in his booth, his face dripping with sweat, his breath ragged. His belly was grotesquely swollen, pressing tightly against the table and spilling over his thighs. Across from him, Eli leaned back in his seat, casually licking syrup off his fingers. His own enormous belly loomed in front of him, but Eli looked completely relaxed, even smug. The man growled softly, staring at Eli with narrowed eyes. Finally, with a heavy, reluctant grunt, he slammed his fist on the table. \"Alright… you win.\" Eli raised an eyebrow, a sly grin spreading across his face. \"Oh, really? I couldn’t tell.\" The man sneered but said nothing. Deep down, anger burned in his gut—along with about twenty pounds of food. Next time, he thought bitterly. Next time, I’ll bury this punk. Struggling to move, he let out a strained groan. \"Hey!\" he barked at the waitstaff. \"Get over here and help me out of this damn booth!\" Two waiters hesitated, exchanging nervous glances. \"NOW!\" It took four waiters to help pry him from the booth. His massive gut wobbled and jiggled as they awkwardly lifted and pulled, chairs scraping against the floor. \"Careful, you idiots!\" the man snapped as they shuffled him toward the exit. As they reached the buffet doors, he turned his head back toward Eli and barked, \"*Enjoy it while it lasts, kid! I’ll be back for lunch!\" Eli chuckled, leaning back and patting his enormous belly. \"I’ll save you a seat.\" The doors swung shut behind the man and his struggling entourage. Eli casually returned to his meal, still picking at what little food remained. Moments later, David entered the buffet, towel draped over his shoulder, looking relaxed and refreshed. He paused near the entrance, watching the massive man and the waiters awkwardly disappear down the hall. David raised an eyebrow. \"Okay… what did I miss?\" Eli smirked, waving lazily. \"Oh, just another pathetic twig who thought he could take me on.\" David sighed, shaking his head. \"Seriously?\" Eli chuckled, licking his fingers. \"It wasn’t even close.\" David walked over to Eli’s booth, eyeing the carnage of empty plates. \"And what about you? You done proving your dominance, or do you want to eat the furniture next?\" Eli grinned, giving his bloated belly a firm pat. \"Eh, I’m kinda over the breakfast stuff. Maybe another buffet with something new would hit the spot.\" David groaned and rubbed his face. \"I was thinking of something that doesn’t involve you eating the ship.\" Eli raised a curious brow. \"Like what?\" David leaned in, smirking. \"How about we head back to the cabin for a bit?\" Eli blinked, then grinned slowly. \"Ohhh.\" David chuckled, already turning toward the exit. \"Come on, before you challenge the next guy to a food duel.\" Eli struggled to get up, his belly wobbling. \"Fine, fine… but I’m picking the next buffet.\" David laughed. \"We’ll see about that.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for lunch buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Enjoy some \"fun\" in cabin",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.DavidLedEliDownT"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLoungedBackIn":[["^Eli lounged back in his booth, a smug grin on his face as he slowly chewed a pastry, deliberately savoring every bite. His massive belly loomed in front of him, tight and bloated, yet he still looked relaxed. Across from him, the enormous man sat slumped over his table, drenched in sweat, his face red and glistening. His stomach was grotesquely swollen, pressing hard against the booth, leaving him barely any room to breathe. But then, Eli’s slow, taunting bite hit a nerve. The man’s heavy-lidded eyes narrowed. No. I won’t lose. With a growl deep in his throat, he slammed his thick palms onto the table, causing plates and cutlery to rattle. Gritting his teeth, he reached for the nearest tray and forced more food into his mouth. His massive hands shook as he crammed handfuls of greasy meat and soggy pastries between his lips. But his body was rejecting every bite. His throat struggled to swallow. Each painful gulp sent a visible ripple through his overstuffed gut, which let out deep, ominous gurgling noises. GRRRRRRGLLL... The man grunted, clutching his stomach. His face twisted in pain, but he refused to stop. His suspenders strained dangerously. The metal clips dug into his fat shoulders, barely holding back the tidal wave of his gut. Then— SNAP! The suspenders shot backward with a violent CRACK, smacking the wall behind him. His enormous belly lurched forward, spilling over his waistband, jiggling heavily. The bloated gut wobbled, and a low, deep creeeeak rumbled from within, like the sound of an overinflated balloon stretching beyond its limit. A nearby waiter cautiously approached, wringing his hands. \"S-sir, maybe you should—\" \"SHUT UP!\" the man roared, not breaking his glare from Eli. With crazed determination, he grabbed another fistful of food and shoved it into his mouth, stuffing his cheeks so full they bulged unnaturally. He squeezed his eyes shut, trembling violently, and forced the massive, disgusting lump of half-chewed food down his throat with a sickening GLK… GLRK… The sound echoed through the silent buffet. Then—nothing. The man froze. His eyes shot wide open. For a split second, the entire room held its breath. And then it happened. CRRRAAAACK! A sickening, wet RIP tore through the air. The man’s swollen belly burst forward, the waistband of his pants exploding, seams shredding apart. His stomach let out a monstrous GROOOOAAAN as it lurched violently. BLUUUUUURP! The pressure gave way in a horrific, uncontrollable surge. Food, grease, and half-digested slop erupted from him, splattering across the table, the walls—and Eli. Shrieks filled the buffet as guests scrambled away, overturning chairs and tables. Plates shattered on the floor. Eli sat there, motionless, blinking slowly as chunks of food dripped from his face and shirt. Then he calmly wiped his face with a napkin, chuckling under his breath. \"Guess he couldn’t handle the heat.\" The buffet was in utter chaos. And then he looked towards the entrance: \"DAVID?!\" Eli glanced up to see David standing at the entrance, frozen in shock. His eyes darted between Eli and the destroyed booth, the collapsed man, and the screaming guests. David’s face went pale. \"What the hell—\" Eli casually raised a sticky hand and waved at him. \"I’m fine!\" Then he pointed lazily at the mess beside him with a smug smirk. \"But he’s not.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to lunch buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for some \"fun\" in cabin",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.DavidLedEliDownT"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"DavidLedEliDownT":[["^David led Eli down the hall to their cabin, unlocking the door with shaky hands. Once inside, Eli moved sluggishly toward the bed, his heavy stomach leading the way. With a contented sigh, he collapsed onto the large mattress, his massive belly rising high into the air like a balloon, the soft fabric of his stretched shirt barely covering it. David lingered in the doorway, eyes locked on Eli’s exposed body. “You going to keep staring, or are you going to help me out of these?” Eli teased, voice thick with amusement. David swallowed, stepping forward. His fingers found the waistband of Eli’s strained shorts, tugging them slowly down over Eli’s thick thighs. The fabric clung tightly before finally slipping free, leaving Eli in nothing but his stretched boxers. David let out a shaky breath. “Looks like it’s not just your stomach that’s full,” David muttered, his hand brushing lower. Eli smirked. “Why don’t you do something about it?” David didn’t need to be told twice. He knelt between Eli’s legs, pulling down his boxers in one slow motion. Without hesitation, David leaned in, taking Eli fully into his mouth. Eli groaned, his hands instinctively finding David’s hair as his hips gave a slight thrust. David worked steadily, deep and purposeful, savoring every reaction he pulled from Eli. Eli’s breath quickened, his stomach quivering slightly with every muffled groan. David didn’t let up, pushing him closer and closer until Eli’s body tensed—then shuddered. David swallowed without pause, drawing every last bit from him before pulling back slowly, lips slick and breathing hard. Eli collapsed further into the mattress, his chest rising and falling in slow, heavy breaths. David wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his eyes dark with need. But he wasn’t finished. Without a word, David stood, hooking his thumbs into his own shorts and dragging them down, exposing himself fully. He climbed onto the bed, straddling Eli’s massive belly. Eli’s eyes flickered upward, a lazy grin spreading across his face. “Now who’s hungry?” David leaned forward, gripping Eli’s belly for support as he slid against him, pressing himself into Eli’s soft, stretched skin. It didn’t take long. David’s body tensed as he let go, releasing everything across Eli’s swollen stomach, gasping for breath as he collapsed beside him. The room was thick with heat and the scent of sweat, cum and satisfaction. David ran a lazy hand over Eli’s belly, smearing his release across the already glistening skin. Eli chuckled breathlessly. “You’re messier than me.” David let out a hoarse laugh. “Not possible.” For a while, they simply lay there, the only sounds their slowing breaths.

His breath was ragged, his face red with fury, and his massive hands were still shoveling food into his mouth. Guests backed away in fear and disgust, but then the murmurs turned to angry shouts. \"He’s dangerous!\" \"He’s eating everything!\" \"He’s a monster! Get him out of here!\" David pushed through the crowd, panicked. \"Wait, stop! Don’t—!\" But it was too late. A group of furious passengers charged forward, grabbing onto Eli's enormous arms and shoulders. Despite his size, Eli was sluggish and overstuffed, unable to fight back. \"H-hey!\" Eli grunted, struggling. \"Let go of me!\" But the crowd was relentless. \"Out! Get him off the ship!\" someone screamed. Together, they shoved and rolled Eli’s bloated form toward the enormous open windows that led out to the buffet's terrace. \"Wait! Don’t do this!\" David pleaded, shoving through the mass of people. \"He didn’t mean it!\" Eli growled, but his swollen belly made it impossible to stand. \"You’ll all regret this!\" he bellowed, but his voice was drowned by the angry crowd. With one final heave, the mob forced Eli over the edge. THWUMP. Eli's massive body toppled over the railing and plummeted into the ocean below. SPLOOOOOSH!

David sprinted to the railing, gripping it tightly, his eyes wide with horror. \"ELI!\" He stared at the churning water, but there was nothing—just the endless expanse of the sea. \"Eli...\" David’s voice broke. The crowd slowly dispersed, satisfied and murmuring smugly. \"Good riddance.\" \"Finally, peace and quiet.\" \"Serves him right.\" David slumped onto a lounge chair on the terrace, head in his hands. His chest tightened, and his throat burned. Tears threatened to spill over. But then— A distant scream echoed from the back of the ship. David’s head snapped up. More screaming. Louder now. He turned toward the ship's stern, and his blood ran cold. Far behind the ship, the water was moving—churning violently. Then something enormous broke the surface. A massive, fleshy pink shape began rising from the waves. It expanded rapidly, swelling larger and larger with every second. David shot to his feet, his heart pounding. \"No way...\" The enormous shape bulged grotesquely, shifting and growing—until David recognized it. It was Eli. But not just Eli. Eli’s head—and his mouth, stretched impossibly wide. David watched in stunned horror as Eli inhaled, sucking in massive amounts of seawater. SSSSHHHHHHHHHH! The sound was deafening, like a tidal wave being pulled backward. Waves of water surged into Eli’s gaping maw, his body swelling to unnatural proportions. His belly ballooned outward, expanding faster than David could comprehend. Crew members and passengers on the upper decks screamed, pointing frantically. \"WHAT IS THAT?!\" \"IT’S HIM!\" \"RUN!\" The ship’s captain, watching the chaos from the bridge, slammed his fist on the controls. \"Full speed ahead! NOW!\" The engines roared, but it was useless. Eli’s monstrous form continued to swell, his enormous mouth dragging the ship backward. Deck chairs, lifeboats, and even passengers began sliding toward the stern as the ship tilted. David clung to the railing, watching helplessly as Eli grew larger than the ship itself. Then— Eli’s eyes narrowed in fury. And he opened his mouth even wider. SSSHHHHHHHHHHH! The suction grew stronger. The ship groaned under the force as the entire vessel began sliding backward. Passengers screamed. Crew members ran. But it was too late. The stern of the ship tilted upward, lifting into the air as Eli’s enormous, yawning maw consumed it. David could only watch as the sky was replaced by the dark, fleshy walls of Eli's throat. The massive jaws closed slowly around the ship. The world darkened. GULP. A deafening, wet swallow echoed. Everything went still. The ship plunged into darkness, surrounded by the oppressive, slimy walls of Eli’s stomach. David stumbled, catching himself against a wall. The ship creaked and groaned as it settled into the massive, pulsating chamber. David stared into the suffocating dark. \"Eli...\" And then—silence.","\n","^<strong>\"GULP!

His hoodie had been discarded, leaving his bare chest exposed, and his sweatpants strained dangerously against his swollen midsection. David stood nearby, shirtless, sipping wine as he admired Eli sprawled across the bed. Ryan moved closer, pulling his tie loose with a smirk. “Well, guess I should get comfortable too.” Without hesitation, Ryan began unbuttoning his shirt, slowly peeling it off before letting it drop to the floor. His pants followed, sliding down his legs until he was standing there completely naked, his arousal already prominent. David let out a low whistle, eyes flicking down with clear appreciation. “Damn, Ryan. Haven’t seen something that big in a while.” Ryan chuckled, cocking an eyebrow. “Better get used to it.” Grinning, Ryan crawled onto the bed beside Eli, the mattress creaking under the combined weight. His hands eagerly roamed over Eli’s enormous belly, fingers tracing the stretched skin, massaging the rounded sides. Ryan didn’t stop there. He leaned in, pressing his hips forward, deliberately letting his hard length bump and grind against the curve of Eli’s belly. Eli let out a low, pleased hum, glancing down at the bold waiter. David laughed, setting his wine down and stripping off the last of his clothes. “Guess I’m overdressed now.” Naked, David joined them on the bed, kneeling beside Eli and grabbing a handful of food. He began tossing pieces of fruit and bread into Eli’s waiting mouth, laughing as Eli chewed and swallowed without pause. Ryan joined in, pushing pieces of cake into Eli’s mouth while grinding himself harder against Eli’s belly. Eli’s belly swelled larger, groaning under the weight of all the food. It spread wider, pushing against the bedposts, forcing the blankets to the floor. The room was thick with heat, sweat, and the scent of food. Then Eli’s hands moved—large, firm, and purposeful. He reached out, wrapping one hand firmly around David and the other around Ryan. Both men gasped at the sudden contact. Eli’s grip was steady but unrelenting, stroking them with slow, deliberate motions. David groaned, his hips jerking forward into Eli’s grasp. Ryan swore under his breath, gripping the mattress as Eli worked them both in sync. The air grew heavier, the only sounds being their breathy moans and the wet sounds of Eli’s belly stretching around them. David was the first to break, his body tensing as he released with a strangled groan. Ryan followed almost instantly, both men shuddering as they spilled everything directly into Eli’s waiting mouth. Eli swallowed it all without hesitation, his throat bobbing slowly as he savored every drop. David collapsed against Eli’s side, panting, while Ryan sprawled on the other side, breathless. Eli licked his lips slowly, smirking. “Delicious.” David laughed weakly. “You really don’t waste anything, do you?” Ryan chuckled, pressing himself closer against Eli’s side. “Why would he?” The three of them lay there, tangled together on the bed, Eli’s massive belly stretching high above them.

Eli grinned, eyes locked on the bar. \"Relaxing is exactly what I’m going to do.\" Before David could say anything, Eli squeezed up to the counter and ordered three beers and two colorful cocktails. He wasted no time, downing the first beer in one long gulp. \"Eli, slow down,\" David warned, watching in disbelief. \"We just got here.\" \"*It’s a vacation!\" Eli laughed, slamming the empty glass down and grabbing a cocktail. \"Gotta let loose!\" \"Yeah, but maybe not all at once—\" But Eli wasn’t listening.

He turned and pushed through the crowd, disappearing into the hall.Eli, now comfortably sprawled in a booth, was surrounded by four attractive men, each of them sipping drinks and staring at him in awe. Plates of snacks—chips, peanuts, pretzels—sat on the table, but they didn’t last long. Eli casually shoveled handfuls into his mouth, washing them down with yet another beer. One of the guys chuckled. \"Dude, how are you even still breathing after all that?\" Eli grinned, leaning back and giving his bloated belly a proud pat. \"*Let’s just say...

He slowly waddled toward the exit, belly sloshing, and made his way to yet another buffet.As night fell, the ship began to rock gently.Soft groans echoed through the ship as waves started to swell, the hull creaking under the rising sea.Eli sat slumped in the center of the Oceanview Buffet, his body nearly swallowed by the enormity of his own bloated stomach. His belly had grown beyond anything imaginable—an enormous, glistening sphere of stretched skin, bloated to a grotesque size. It wasn’t just big. It was monumental. His gut rose up in front of him like a swollen dome, towering so high it nearly reached the light fixtures above. It spread outward in every direction, pressing against overturned chairs, pushing aside tables, and sprawling across the floor in a massive, quivering expanse of flesh. The buffet seemed to shrink around him. Entire food stations were hidden behind the mountainous curve of his belly. Guests and staff had long since cleared the area, leaving Eli alone with his feast and his colossal form. His breathing was slow and heavy, each exhale making his belly shift and jiggle slightly. The tight, overworked skin of his stomach groaned under the impossible pressure, creaking and gurgling as it strained to contain the sheer volume of food inside. GRRROOOAAAN. Eli blinked lazily. He felt it. A subtle shift. The ship rocked gently beneath him. At first, it was barely noticeable. His massive belly gave a soft, slow wobble as the floor tilted slightly under the motion of the waves. \"Huh...\" Eli muttered, feeling the strange sensation as his enormous gut subtly shifted, rolling just a fraction from side to side. But then the ship tilted again—harder this time. His belly lurched, the tremendous mass of it sliding a few inches to the right. \"Oh... oh no.\" The ship rocked again, stronger. His massive stomach shifted more, dragging his entire body along with it. The sheer weight of it was uncontrollable, a living avalanche of flesh. Then the ship dipped sharply. THUMP. Eli’s gigantic belly rolled hard to the left, pulling him with it. \"Wait—WAIT!\" Eli shouted, flailing his arms, but it was useless. THUMP. THUMP. Each tilt of the ship sent his bloated form rolling farther and faster, his massive stomach slamming into tables and chairs, flattening anything in its path. The deep, echoing gurgles inside his stomach grew louder, mingling with the sounds of creaking wood and shattering plates. And then, the ship gave a violent sway. BOOOOM. Eli's gigantic belly lifted and rolled, turning him into a living wrecking ball. His enormous body barreled across the buffet floor, crushing tables, toppling chairs, and sending buffet trays flying. Each tilt of the ship made it worse, sending Eli careening from one end of the buffet to the other, his colossal gut dragging him faster with every shift. The walls groaned under the impacts. His belly, now larger than most of the tables in the room combined, wobbled and swayed with terrifying momentum, slamming into anything in its way. GROOOAAAAAAN. The monstrous, bloated sphere of his stomach shifted and rolled with unstoppable force. The ship groaned in protest.Up in the Bridge, alarms blared.\"Captain!\" a crew member shouted. \"We’re getting dangerous tilt warnings! Stabilizers are active, but they’re not compensating!\"The captain narrowed his eyes. \"That’s impossible. Get me a visual on the lower decks!\"The security feed flickered on, showing the chaos in the buffet hall.\"What in the—\"The captain leaned in.There, rolling uncontrollably, was Eli—a giant, wobbling ball of flesh, smashing everything in sight.\"*What the hell is that?!\" the captain barked.\"Sir,\" an officer stammered, \"it’s a passenger.\"\"A PASSENGER?!\"\"Yes, sir.

It’s not enough!\"The ship rocked harder, tilting dangerously. Crew and passengers alike were thrown off balance.Eli, still rolling helplessly, was now a force of nature.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Stop the rocking",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Capsizing",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theCaptainsFaceD"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theOceanviewBuff"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"sceneOverindulge":[["^Scene – Overindulgence in the Cabin The room was heavy with warmth and the scent of food. David and Ryan lay draped over Eli’s massive form, their breathing slow and steady in the aftermath of their indulgence. Then, without warning, Eli’s voice shattered the stillness. “I’m still starving!” David jolted upright, blinking in surprise. Ryan sat up, staring wide-eyed at Eli’s swollen belly. “You’re joking,” David muttered. Eli’s stomach let out a deep, guttural growl, shaking the bed slightly. Ryan glanced at David and then back to Eli, a grin spreading across his face. “Guess we’re not done yet.” Without hesitation, both men scrambled to their feet. Ryan grabbed whatever food was left on the nearby trays while David hurried to the mini-fridge, pulling out anything remotely edible. “Open wide,” Ryan teased, stuffing pastries and fruits into Eli’s waiting mouth. Eli didn’t need encouragement. He devoured everything eagerly, barely chewing before swallowing. There was a knock at the door. David, breathless, grabbed a towel and hastily wrapped it around his waist. He stumbled to the door and cracked it open. Another cart of food stood in the hallway, steam rising from covered trays. The waiter barely had time to greet him before David cut him off. “Perfect. Just leave it here.” David dragged the cart into the room, slamming the door behind him. “More fuel for the fire,” David laughed, lifting a tray. Ryan joined in, both men feeding Eli relentlessly. Eli’s belly swelled further, pushing higher into the air, forcing the blankets and pillows off the bed. Wine bottles were passed between them, the alcohol fueling their reckless pace. None of them noticed how Eli’s stomach began pressing outward, filling the cabin inch by inch. Plates clattered to the floor, forgotten. Eli’s belly pushed against the walls, the ceiling, slowly devouring the room itself. — Outside, another waiter approached the cabin with yet another cart of food. He knocked politely. “Room service!” Silence. He knocked again, louder. “Room service delivery for Cabin 408!” Still nothing. Frowning, the waiter reached for his master key card and swiped it. The door clicked but opened only a crack. Confused, the waiter leaned in and gave the door a shove. It barely budged, meeting some kind of soft, firm resistance. “What the…?” He reached into the gap and his fingers met something warm, smooth, and faintly pulsing. The waiter yelped, jerking his hand back. “Hello?” he called out, his voice higher than intended. From within, muffled laughter echoed, followed by Ryan’s voice, lazy and slurred. “Yeah, uh… just leave it. Something’s stuck in the door. Don’t bring any more.” Then, as if to punctuate the moment, a deep, unsettling GROOOOAN rumbled through the cabin walls. The waiter paled, stepping back, his heart pounding. Without another word, he abandoned the cart and hurried down the hallway. Back inside, Ryan chuckled, tossing another handful of food into Eli’s mouth. David leaned against the swollen curve of Eli’s belly, laughing breathlessly. “I think we broke room service.” Eli’s belly let out another ominous gurgle. Ryan smirked. “Good. Now, open wide\". Eli let out a satisfied groan, swallowing the last of the food David had managed to shove into his mouth. His massive belly lurched forward, pressing further into the already cramped space. There was a soft, dull thud as Eli’s bloated stomach surged outward, slamming the slightly ajar cabin door shut with a final, solid click. David burst into laughter, nearly falling back against the wall. Ryan, wedged tightly between Eli’s head and the curve of his belly, looked around in disbelief. “Okay, this is insane.” Around them, Eli’s belly filled every inch of the cabin. The bed was no longer visible, swallowed by the vast expanse of Eli’s swollen form. Only Eli’s head and shoulders peeked out from the massive dome of his stomach, with David and Ryan squished close beside him. Ryan laughed breathlessly, running a hand through his hair. “How the hell am I supposed to get back to my cabin? I have to work in the morning!” David couldn’t stop laughing, pressing his forehead against Eli’s shoulder. “Guess you’re staying here tonight, buddy!” Ryan snorted. “Yeah, but seriously, how am I getting out of here?” David smirked, wiping tears from his eyes. “Oh, don’t worry. Eli knows a magic trick.” Ryan blinked, glancing at Eli. “Wait, what magic trick?” Eli chuckled deeply, his entire belly vibrating with the sound. “No magic tonight.” David leaned in, poking Eli’s bloated side. “Oh, come on. Don’t be a jerk.” Eli burst into laughter, the whole cabin shaking slightly with the force of it. Ryan groaned, shaking his head but grinning. “I’m so screwed.” David grinned wider, leaning back comfortably against Eli’s massive side. “Nah, you’ll be fine. Probably.” The room echoed with their shared laughter, the ridiculousness of the moment sinking in.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.sceneOverindulge.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Do the magic trick",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.sceneOverindulge.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.ryanSatOnTheEdge"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliStumbledIntoT":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli stumbled into the luxurious cabin, still giggling from the alcohol fogging his brain. The soft lighting cast a warm glow over the massive bed and sleek furniture. “Damn… this is fancy,” Eli slurred, eyeing the space. He flopped back onto the bed, arms splayed out. “So, uh… where’s the food?” The room fell strangely quiet. Eli’s eyes slowly drifted to the four men who had followed him in. The muscular one—tall, broad, and smirking—reached down and gave himself a firm squeeze through his jeans. “Oh, don’t worry, big guy. You’re gonna have your hands—and mouth—full.” The others chuckled darkly, starting to tug off their shirts. Eli’s tipsy grin faltered. “Hah… okay, but seriously. Where’s the actual food?” The muscular man took a step forward, his smirk widening. “Oh, there’s plenty to eat.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unmistakable. Eli blinked, his brain slowly piecing things together. “Wait… wait, hold on.” Eli shifted uncomfortably on the bed, scooting back. “I-I think there’s been a misunderstanding.” The men only laughed. One leaned in, voice low. “No misunderstanding, cutie.” Another pulled his shirt over his head, revealing a tattoo snaking down his chest. “We know exactly what we’re doing.” Eli’s back hit the headboard. His breathing quickened. “Okay, okay,” Eli raised his hands, palms out. “Look, I’m not into this, alright? Let’s just chill.” The muscular man climbed onto the bed, crawling toward him. “Relax, little guy. You’re gonna love this.” He lunged forward, aiming to grab Eli’s face. Panic surged through Eli’s body. Instinct took over. His mouth opened wide— SHLOORP! The man vanished in an instant. Silence. The other three froze, eyes wide in shock. “What the fuck?!” one of them shrieked. Eli blinked, his hand slowly covering his mouth. “Oh… shit.” The second man bolted, but Eli lunged— GLURRRP! Gone. The remaining two backed into the wall, their faces pale. “This isn’t happening,” one of them whispered. Eli stood slowly, his belly visibly heavier now, bulging outward. “I told you to back off,” Eli muttered, voice low and shaky. One man tried to make a run for the door. WHUMP! Eli’s hand shot out, gripping his shoulder. GLUUUURP! Another gone. The last man collapsed to the floor, scrambling backward. “P-please, man! I—I won’t say anything!” Eli stared at him, chest heaving. “Yeah… no.” SKRRRRRK! The man disappeared, his screams cut off. Eli slumped back against the bedframe, groaning as he clutched his now massive belly. “Fuck… that wasn’t what I signed up for,” he muttered. His bloated stomach gurgled loudly, the weight of his “meal” making it hard to move. Groaning, Eli staggered to his feet, belly swaying. “David’s gonna kill me.” He shuffled slowly through the hallway, cradling his swollen gut. “Ugh… I need to lie down…”","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliStumbledIntoT.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Back to David",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliStumbledIntoT.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theLongDimlyLitH"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theCaptainsFaceD":[["^The captain’s face darkened. \"You've got to be kidding me.\" \"Orders, sir?\" Captain Reed’s mind raced. \"We need to get him off the main decks—immediately.

Block off every exit except the cargo lift. Force him into the lower decks.\" \"Yes, Captain!\"Down below, the crew sprang into action. Crew members scrambled to rearrange furniture, creating barriers from tables, chairs, and carts, forming narrow paths to direct Eli’s movement. Staff blocked off hallways with anything they could find, herding the rolling giant toward the industrial cargo elevator located deep in the ship’s service area. \"Come on, move it!\" a security officer barked as more tables were stacked into makeshift walls.Meanwhile, Eli groaned as the ship rocked again, his body rolling sluggishly. \"Ugh… my head...\" Eli whimpered, his bloated belly swaying heavily. \"This isn’t fun anymore...\" But the tilted ship forced him to roll, bumping and sliding along the narrow, barricaded paths. Each tilt pushed him closer and closer to the cargo lift. \"He’s almost there!\" a crewman shouted. One final shift of the ship sent Eli crashing into the massive elevator. THUD! \"YES!\" a security officer cheered. \"Shut the doors, NOW!\" The industrial doors groaned as they slid shut, barely containing Eli’s enormous body, which filled the entire elevator. \"Send him down!\" The lift rumbled to life, descending deep into the ship’s technical storage levels.The elevator clanged as it reached the bottom. The doors creaked open, revealing the dark, cavernous cargo hold. Eli let out a miserable groan. \"Ohhh… my head is spinning...\" A few crew members cautiously approached, stepping over scattered crates. \"Just… stay here,\" one of them said nervously. \"Please.\" \"Not like I can go anywhere,\" Eli grumbled, giving his massive belly a soft, defeated pat. \"We’re staying to keep watch,\" another added, clearly terrified. \"Lucky me,\" Eli muttered, slumping further into the cold metal floor.Back on the Bridge, the ship’s violent rocking began to slow. \"Stabilizers are holding, Captain!\" Captain Reed exhaled in relief. \"Good. Keep monitoring. And tomorrow morning, I want a full investigation. Find out how a passenger could eat enough to nearly capsize the ship.\" \"Yes, sir.\"Meanwhile, in his cabin, David stirred as the swaying of the ship finally stopped. \"What the...\" Still half-asleep, David rubbed his eyes and stumbled into the hall, heading toward the buffet. He froze when he saw the destruction. Tables were shattered, walls were cracked, and trays of food lay scattered across the floor. Eli was nowhere to be seen. David grabbed a nearby waiter by the arm. \"Hey! What the hell happened here?! Where’s Eli?\" The waiter, pale and shaken, stammered, \"T-they took him... to the lower decks.

THUMP. The ship swayed again, harder this time. THUMP… CRASH! Eli’s enormous body rolled uncontrollably, smashing through tables, chairs, and buffet stations. The sounds of shattering glass and splintering wood echoed through the hall. The ship groaned beneath the weight and movement, tilting more with every impact. Up on the Bridge, alarms blared. \"Captain!\" a crew member shouted. \"The stabilizers are failing! We’re tilting too far!\" \"Impossible!\" the captain barked. \"Dear God,\" the captain muttered. Then the ship lurched violently. BOOOOOM. With one final, catastrophic roll, Eli’s massive body slammed into the outer wall of the buffet. CRAAAACK—BOOOOM! The metal hull buckled and shattered like paper. Eli's enormous, bloated body burst through the wall, tearing through steel and glass, and was violently flung into the dark, stormy ocean. SPLOOOOOSH! Cold seawater rushed into the gaping hole in the ship’s side. The entire vessel groaned as it tilted sharply. Passengers screamed, sliding helplessly as the ship leaned further. CRASH! Plates, tables, and even entire rooms were swallowed by the rushing water. \"Abandon ship!\" a crew member yelled, but it was too late. The massive cruise ship tilted completely and began to capsize. One by one, passengers and crew were thrown into the raging ocean, their screams drowned by the roar of collapsing metal. Some managed to cling to floating debris, others scrambled into a few life rafts that were successfully launched. The once-grand ship slipped slowly beneath the black waves, swallowed by the sea. Rain pouring from the dark sky. In the faint glow of emergency lights and distant lightning, thousands of passengers bobbed helplessly in the cold water. Their terrified faces stared at the spot where the ship had vanished. The ocean was eerily still for a moment, save for the sound of sobbing and the distant crash of waves. Crew members in the surviving lifeboats called out through megaphones. \"Stay calm! We’re getting everyone to safety!\" one of them shouted. \"The worst is over! You’re safe now!\" People clung to life preservers and drifted toward the boats, hope flickering in their eyes. But then… A low, ominous rumble echoed beneath the waves. It started as a faint growl, growing deeper and louder, like the sound of a massive waterfall roaring in the distance. The water began to pull. \"W-what’s happening?\" someone stammered. The surface of the ocean started dragging violently in one direction. \"Oh my God…\" a voice trembled. \"What is that?!\" Then, through the darkness, something massive began to rise. A colossal, pale-pink mass broke the surface, stretching impossibly wide. It was a gigantic belly, glistening in the rain. And above it, an even more terrifying sight— Eli's enormous, gaping mouth, wide open, inhaling with a monstrous, endless suction. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH! The water rushed toward him, dragging everything with it. \"SWIM!\" someone screamed. But it was useless. Lifeboats were ripped from the surface, spinning helplessly toward the gaping maw. Men, women, and children screamed as they were pulled backward, limbs thrashing. The suction was unstoppable. One by one, the passengers were sucked into Eli's massive mouth, vanishing into the dark abyss. GULP. The lifeboats followed, tumbling end over end before disappearing between his enormous lips. GULP. Crew members, debris, everything was devoured. The howling wind and the crashing waves were drowned out by the relentless, monstrous suction. And then— Silence. Eli’s massive form bobbed in the dark water. His enormous belly, now impossibly larger, heaved with a satisfied groan. \"Uuuurrrp.\" Slowly, Eli closed his mouth, letting the last echoes of the storm fade. He lazily lifted one massive hand and gave his belly a firm, proud pat, sending slow ripples across its stretched surface. \"Perfect.\"","\n","^<strong>\"One minute it’s a cruise, the next it’s Eli’s Seafood Special.

Do you know how much food is about to go to waste?” David rolled his eyes. “Don’t be dramatic. You’ll eat again in five minutes.” Ryan blinked between them, his curiosity piqued. “Wait, what trick are you guys talking about?” David smirked at Eli. “Tell him.” Eli sighed dramatically, muttering, “This is so stupid.” Ryan laughed, swaying slightly from the alcohol. “No, no! I need to see this now. Come on, man, don’t leave me hanging!” Eli sighed again but lifted his hand, placing it flat over the crest of his massive belly. “Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.” David grinned widely. “Oh, this is going to be good.” Eli closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. Then, it started. A low, deep rumble echoed from within Eli’s stomach. Ryan’s eyes widened as the impossibly large belly began to shift, shrinking slowly at first, then faster. The curve of Eli’s massive stomach deflated like a balloon losing air, the skin tightening and pulling back toward his frame. Plates and trays clattered to the floor as Eli’s belly rapidly vanished. Within moments, Eli was lying flat on the bed—completely slim, his hoodie hanging loosely over a perfectly flat stomach. Ryan’s mouth hung open. David snorted, covering his mouth to hold back his laughter. Ryan blinked once. Twice. Then he burst out laughing, collapsing back onto the mattress. “What the—where the hell did it go?!” Ryan cackled, lunging forward and pressing both hands against Eli’s flat stomach. “WHERE’S THE FOOD?!” Eli swatted lazily at him, smirking. “Hey, hey, careful! I’m delicate now.” Ryan kept pressing, kneading at Eli’s belly like he was trying to open a secret door. “Nope! I don’t buy it. It’s gotta be in here somewhere!” David laughed so hard he had to clutch his side. “Oh my god, you’re ridiculous.” Ryan finally slumped back, still chuckling. “Okay, okay. That was insane. But I seriously gotta go. Morning shift’s going to be hell.” He stumbled to his feet, pulling on his clothes. “I’m impressed, though. You’re full of surprises.” David chuckled. “More than you know.” Ryan paused at the door, smirking. “Oh, almost forgot.” He pushed the door open and nudged the food cart still parked outside into the room with a wink. “Thought this might come in handy later.” Before David or Eli could respond, Ryan slipped out, the door clicking softly behind him. For a moment, the room was still. Then Eli’s stomach growled loudly. David turned slowly to Eli, eyebrow raised. Eli’s eyes locked onto the cart. In one swift, unexpected motion, Eli lunged forward, mouth stretching impossibly wide. GULP. The entire cart—trays, plates, and all—vanished down his throat in a single massive swallow. Eli slumped back onto the bed, his belly now bulging forward in the exact boxy shape of the cart. David stared for a beat before bursting into laughter, doubling over. “You’re unbelievable,” David wheezed. “You swallowed the whole thing!” Eli patted the sharp corner of his cart-shaped belly and grinned. “Hey, waste not, want not.” David wiped his eyes, still laughing. “Alright, you maniac, let’s get some sleep before you start eyeing the furniture.” Eli chuckled, curling onto his side as best as he could.

The cavernous space was dimly lit by flickering overhead lights, casting long, eerie shadows across the endless rows of metal shelves. Crates and boxes were stacked high, labeled and organized—supplies meant to last the entire voyage. Two crew members sat on a distant crate, nervously watching Eli. Their eyes flicked between each other and the massive, bloated figure lying in the middle of the storage area. Eli’s enormous belly slowly rose and fell, still groaning from its impossible size. But then Eli’s eyes slowly opened. He blinked, taking in his surroundings. And then he saw them. Rows upon rows of shelves… all filled with food. His eyes gleamed. GRRRRROOOOAAAAAN.

Ryan swiped the keycard, and the doors slid open. They rode in tense silence, descending into the lower decks. Ding. The doors opened to a dark, narrow hallway. The distant sounds of something… wet and heavy echoed from deeper within. Ryan swallowed nervously. \"What is that?\" David didn’t answer. He broke into a run. They rounded a corner—and stopped dead in their tracks. The massive cargo hold, once filled with crates, was now half-empty. In its place was Eli. Or rather, Eli’s gigantic, pulsing belly, rising up like a fleshy mountain. It dominated the space, swelling larger and larger with every heaving gulp. Crates splintered as Eli grabbed them whole, shoving them into his mouth—wood, metal, and all—uncaring of what was inside. CRUNCH. GLRK. GROOOOAN. \"Oh my God,\" David whispered.

His stomach groaned louder with each swallow, stretching tighter, swelling larger. \"Eli!\" David shouted louder. Nothing. Eli was lost in it, devouring everything in sight.

His eyes stayed locked on Eli, his breath shallow. \"Ryan!\" David grabbed his arm. Ryan flinched, snapping out of it. \"I-I—what do we even do?!\" David’s mind raced. \"I don’t know, but if we don’t stop him, he’s going to eat the entire ship!\" Eli groaned deeply, grabbing another massive crate and tilting it into his mouth.

His eyes narrowed. Inside the cargo hold, the scene was beyond comprehension. Eli’s massive, bloated form dominated the space, his enormous belly stretching high, almost brushing the ceiling.

Reed stepped inside, the air thick with the smell of sweat, metal, and something far worse. Eli's mountainous body shifted slightly as he continued lazily licking his fingers, oblivious to the captain's presence. Reed raised the megaphone. \"Passenger Eli!\" his voice boomed, echoing through the cavernous hold. No response. \"This is Captain Reed. You are in direct violation of ship safety protocols. You need to cease what you're doing and cooperate immediately.\" Still, Eli continued chewing, casually wiping his hands on the stretched fabric of his shirt.

With shocking strength, Eli ripped a massive chunk of the dividing wall free and casually shoved it into his mouth. GRRK. GULP. Metal groaned and bent as Eli forced his way forward, the twisted wall giving way as he burst into the next cargo hold. Steel screeched and snapped as Eli’s massive body bulldozed through, devouring everything in his path. Reed stood frozen in the now empty hold, bits of debris still clattering around him. He slowly lowered the megaphone. There was a long, cold silence.

The ship lurched violently as it scraped onto the shore, sliding forward before grinding to a full stop. Dust and dirt kicked up as the hulking vessel sat awkwardly on the beach. Silence. Then— Eli snorted, blinking groggily. His massive belly shifted slightly. \"Huh? Wha—?\" \"Eli!\" David’s voice echoed. Eli’s groggy eyes turned upward. He spotted David and Ryan peering down at him. Eli gave a slow, sleepy wave. \"Oh, hey guys...\" David called down. \"Looks like the cruise ended early!\" Eli blinked, then gave a sheepish shrug. \"*Not my fault! It was an accident!\" David rubbed his face. \"Yeah, sure it was.\" Then he smirked. \"Come on. If you let yourself shrink, we can get out of here.\" Eli pouted. \"But my belly’s never been this big! I wanna enjoy it!\" David raised an eyebrow. \"You can’t even move right now.\" Eli whined, hands pressed on his massive stomach. \"Ugh, fine.\" David looked at Ryan. \"Hold on. This might get weird.\" Both David and Ryan jumped off the dangling staircase, landing softly on Eli’s pillowy belly. \"Alright, Eli. Do it.\" Eli sighed dramatically. \"Here goes...\" He took a deep breath—and then his enormous belly shrank with a series of loud, wet gurgles. GRRRROOOOAAAAAN... David and Ryan wobbled as Eli’s body deflated, shrinking down, his massive gut slowly pulling back in. Moments later, Eli was his normal, slim self, lying sprawled out on the metal floor. \"That sucked,\" Eli grumbled, patting his now-flat stomach. David smirked. \"Come on, let’s get out of here.\" They made their way to a nearby emergency hatch, pushing it open.","\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The ship lay awkwardly on its side, stranded on a desolate shore. No civilization in sight—just sand, grass, and endless waves. David, Ryan, and Eli climbed down onto the soft sand, the salty breeze brushing past them. For a moment, they just stood there, staring at the wreck of the once-grand cruise ship. Then— GRRRROOOOOWL. Eli’s stomach grumbled loudly. He blinked, then sheepishly grinned. \"I’m hungry.\" David and Ryan stared at him in disbelief. Then they both burst into laughter. \"Eli, you’re always hungry!\" David howled. Ryan doubled over, laughing until tears rolled down his cheeks. Eli chuckled along, shrugging. \"What? You guys want breakfast or what?\" And with that, the three of them turned and began walking away from the wreck, disappearing into the quiet morning.","\n","^<strong>\"Well done!
