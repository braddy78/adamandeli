His eyes flickered across the screen, scanning profiles on the gainer dating site he had frequented for the past several months. The routine had become almost mechanical‚Äîfilter, scroll, click, disappointment. He had been down this road too many times before. Countless messages exchanged, fleeting connections made, but none of the encounters ever lived up to the stories or promises made online. Some barely ate more than an average person at a buffet, while others claimed to have limitless appetites but tapped out after a few pizzas. David wasn‚Äôt looking for just anyone. He wanted someone exceptional‚Äîsomeone whose hunger seemed to defy nature. His fascination with gainers wasn‚Äôt new, but it had intensified over the years. He imagined hosting grand feasts, watching as his guest devoured everything he could prepare, the pile of empty plates growing until the food ran out. But that fantasy remained elusive. The site refreshed, and David sighed, leaning back in his chair. His finger hovered over the trackpad, ready to close the tab and abandon the search for the night. But then‚Äî A new profile appeared. The username was simple: <strong>Eli22</strong>. David clicked it without hesitation. The profile photo was of a slim young man with pale skin, tousled dark hair, and a faint smirk tugging at his lips. Eli‚Äôs bio was short but to the point: <em><strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like the others. Bottomless.‚Äù</strong></em> David‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. The simplicity of the message intrigued him. He scrolled further. No public eating photos, no flashy displays of gluttony‚Äîjust a few ordinary pictures of Eli in oversized hoodies and sweatpants. His lean frame made the idea of such a claim seem almost absurd. Curiosity got the better of him. David typed out a brief message. David: Hey, I saw your profile. You say you‚Äôre bottomless? What does that mean? He hovered over the send button, hesitating for just a second before clicking it. The message marked as ‚Äúsent‚Äù and David closed his laptop, assuming that like most nights, he wouldn‚Äôt hear anything back. But as he stood to head to the kitchen, his laptop chimed. A new message. Eli: It means exactly what it says. I can eat. A lot. David‚Äôs eyes widened. He sat back down. David: A lot like‚Ä¶ how much? Eli: Enough to clean out your kitchen. Maybe more. David smiled to himself, his excitement growing. David: I‚Äôd like to see that. Eli: Tomorrow night?

The golden skin crackled faintly as he set it onto the counter. Alongside it, bowls of creamy mashed potatoes, freshly baked bread, and a plate of grilled vegetables waited, steam curling up invitingly. David took a step back, hands on his hips, scanning the table with satisfaction. It was more food than he typically made for guests, but after the conversation with Eli, he figured better safe than sorry. A sharp knock echoed through the apartment. Right on time. David wiped his hands on a towel and made his way to the door. When he opened it, he blinked twice, masking a flicker of surprise. Eli stood there, thin and small beneath an oversized hoodie that hung loosely over his frame. The sleeves extended just past his wrists, and the sweatpants he wore sagged slightly at the waist. David couldn‚Äôt help but raise an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt kidding about being slim,‚Äù David commented with a smirk, stepping aside. Eli‚Äôs lips twitched in amusement as he stepped inside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deceiving, I know.‚Äù David glanced him over again, shaking his head playfully. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I made enough after all.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes flicked toward the kitchen, and David caught a glimpse of something predatory beneath his casual demeanor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you made plenty.‚Äù David chuckled, leading him to the dining table. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù They sat, and David began plating generous portions‚Äîtwo drumsticks, a heaping pile of mashed potatoes, and a thick slice of bread. He placed Eli‚Äôs plate in front of him, watching with curiosity. Eli didn‚Äôt hesitate. The first drumstick disappeared in three bites, bone stripped clean and placed neatly to the side. The second followed suit just as swiftly. The mashed potatoes, which David expected to take some effort, vanished in spoonfuls, as if Eli had been starving for days. David‚Äôs fork paused mid-air as he watched Eli tear through his plate, eyes narrowing slightly. ‚ÄúThat was fast,‚Äù David remarked. Eli met his gaze, chewing the last piece of bread calmly. ‚ÄúI told you I was hungry.‚Äù David leaned back in his chair, still processing. ‚ÄúI can see that. I‚Äôve barely touched my plate.‚Äù Eli licked a stray bit of butter from his thumb, glancing at the table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not finished yet, are you?‚Äù David raised an eyebrow, bemused. ‚ÄúNo, but there‚Äôs more. Let me get it.‚Äù He retrieved the rest of the food from the counter‚Äîhalf the chicken, an untouched loaf of bread, and more potatoes. He set the serving dishes between them, expecting Eli to pace himself. Instead, Eli reached forward without hesitation, piling his plate high again. David watched as piece by piece, the meal disappeared. It was methodical, almost mesmerizing. The way Eli ate wasn‚Äôt rushed or messy, but each bite was purposeful, driven by a hunger that didn‚Äôt seem to fade. David‚Äôs eyes flickered to Eli‚Äôs stomach, which remained hidden beneath the folds of his hoodie, though the fabric seemed to sit a little tighter than before. ‚ÄúHow are you even fitting all that?‚Äù David asked, only half-joking. Eli grinned, finishing the last bite of chicken. ‚ÄúEfficient packing.‚Äù David snorted, shaking his head. ‚ÄúEfficient or not, I think you‚Äôre on your way to clearing me out.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs gaze drifted toward the fridge. ‚ÄúAnything else left?‚Äù David laughed but noted the seriousness in Eli‚Äôs voice.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard, reluctant to let the conversation end. There was something captivating about Eli‚Äôs confidence, something that hinted at more beneath the surface. David: You‚Äôre not the first guy I‚Äôve met who claimed to eat a lot. Most barely finish a couple of pizzas. He hesitated, wondering if the message sounded too dismissive. But his curiosity outweighed his doubt, and he hit send. The reply came faster than he expected. Eli: I‚Äôm not like them. David smirked to himself, leaning forward over his laptop. David: That‚Äôs what they all say. Eli: I don‚Äôt just say it. I mean it. David: So you can eat? Eli: A lot. David's eyes narrowed at the screen, the cursor blinking in silence as he waited. There was something almost playful in Eli‚Äôs short responses‚Äîconfident but not bragging. David: How much is a lot? Eli: Enough. David felt a twinge of amusement and frustration at the vague reply. David: That‚Äôs not very convincing. Eli: Oh? Do you need proof? David‚Äôs fingers danced across the keyboard. David: Yeah. I‚Äôve been burned before. A pause. Eli: Burned?

But Eli‚Äôs eyes barely flickered in appreciation. Instead, he immediately grabbed the nearest loaf of bread, tearing it in half and cramming the pieces into his mouth like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in days. David took his seat slowly, watching in stunned silence as Eli devoured everything within arm‚Äôs reach. Chicken bones were stripped clean in seconds, potatoes scooped directly from the serving bowl, leaving nothing but traces of gravy in its wake. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù David began cautiously, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen someone eat this much this fast.‚Äù Eli grinned around a mouthful of bread, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYou said to bring my appetite.‚Äù David laughed nervously. ‚ÄúYeah, but this feels like feeding a black hole.‚Äù Eli merely shrugged, already reaching for the next plate. His belly, which had started out flat beneath the hoodie, gradually swelled with each passing minute. The hem of his sweatshirt lifted slightly, exposing the pale skin stretched taut around his growing midsection. David‚Äôs curiosity shifted to mild concern. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I can make more, but‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Eli interrupted, fixing David with a look that was almost pleading. ‚ÄúWhatever you have left.‚Äù David hesitated for a moment before sighing and heading to the fridge. He pulled out whatever he could find‚Äîleftover pasta, frozen pizzas, even a full cake he had been saving for later in the week. He set it all down on the table, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to eat me out of house and home.‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt respond. He was already digging in. By the time David finished half of his own plate, Eli had cleared not only the dinner but everything from the fridge as well. The shelves inside sat barren, save for a jar of mustard and an expired yogurt David had forgotten about. Eli leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. His belly pressed hard into the table‚Äôs edge, the hoodie barely clinging to him. The round curve protruded heavily into his lap, lifting his shirt enough to expose his navel. David crossed his arms, raising a brow. ‚ÄúSatisfied yet?‚Äù Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, glancing toward the pantry door. ‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù David followed his gaze, chuckling in disbelief. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù Eli replied, standing with effort. His belly shifted outward, hanging slightly over the waistband of his sweatpants as he lumbered toward the pantry. David trailed after him, leaning in the doorway as Eli rifled through the shelves. Boxes of cereal, jars of pasta sauce, and canned goods began to vanish into his mouth. It wasn‚Äôt rushed or messy‚Äîeach item simply disappeared with a few large bites. ‚ÄúThat was a family-sized box,‚Äù David remarked as Eli finished the cereal. Eli shrugged, swallowing the last handful dry. ‚ÄúFamily-sized for someone else.‚Äù The pantry, much like the fridge, was soon left bare. Eli stepped back into the kitchen, rubbing his exposed belly, which now resembled a large, round ball beneath his stretched hoodie. He turned toward the sink, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúI need something to drink,‚Äù he said casually, as if he hadn‚Äôt just obliterated David‚Äôs entire food supply. David snorted. ‚ÄúYeah, I guess after all that, you‚Äôd be thirsty.‚Äù Eli twisted the faucet, cupping his hands beneath the flow of water. He drank directly from the stream, gulping long and deep.

A few seconds passed, and then a notification popped up. Eli had sent three images. David hesitated briefly before clicking to open them. The first image showed a table overflowing with food‚Äîan elaborate Thanksgiving spread. There was a massive turkey, bowls of mashed potatoes, stuffing, pies, and countless side dishes. The sheer amount of food looked excessive, even <em>for </em>a large family gathering. The second photo was taken from the same angle but after the meal. Every dish on the table was empty, picked clean as if a small army had devoured the feast. Plates were stacked, and the remnants of the turkey were reduced to bones. David leaned in closer. It was hard to believe one person could eat that much. The third image, however, told a different story. The camera was zoomed in on Eli‚Äôs torso. His oversized hoodie was pulled up just enough to reveal his stomach‚Äîmassive and round, stretched to the limit, filling most of the frame. The skin was taut, pale, and shiny under the room‚Äôs warm lighting. His hand rested on top of his belly, as if to emphasize its size. Eli: That was last Thanksgiving. David felt his breath hitch slightly. David: You ate all of that? Eli: Mhm. Everything on the table. David: No one helped you? Eli: Nope. Just me. David couldn‚Äôt help but imagine the scene‚ÄîEli, sitting alone at the table, methodically working his way through dish after dish, belly gradually swelling until it reached the size in the photo.

The room was bathed in the warm glow of overhead lights, casting gentle shadows on the table where David and Eli sat. Unlike the frenzy David had half-expected, Eli‚Äôs eating was almost‚Ä¶ graceful. He worked through his plate with quiet precision, cutting each piece of chicken neatly, scooping mashed potatoes with measured swipes, chewing slowly but steadily. David leaned on his hand, elbow propped against the table, watching with growing curiosity. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù David said, offering a slight smirk, ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd tear into this like a wild animal.‚Äù Eli glanced up briefly, a faint smile tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to rush.‚Äù His fork slid under another slice of chicken, which vanished moments later, swallowed with ease. David noticed the way Eli‚Äôs posture stayed relaxed, his shoulders loose as if he wasn‚Äôt aware‚Äîor didn‚Äôt care‚Äîhow much he had already consumed. The portions David had initially thought were excessive were steadily shrinking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pacing yourself,‚Äù David remarked, refilling Eli‚Äôs plate without hesitation. Eli‚Äôs eyes flicked toward the second serving. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier that way. Just keep it coming.‚Äù David raised a brow but complied. Watching Eli eat was like witnessing some hypnotic performance‚Äîan endless rhythm of bite, swallow, and subtle request for more. Unlike the chaotic energy David imagined, this was something far more controlled. David wasn‚Äôt sure if it was impressive or unnerving. Plates emptied one after another. David caught glimpses of Eli‚Äôs stomach as his hoodie gradually lifted, exposing a thin strip of smooth skin that seemed to tighten ever so slightly with each passing plate. Yet Eli‚Äôs expression never shifted‚Äîhe ate as if he were completely unaware of the gradual expansion pressing against the waistband of his sweatpants. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre enjoying this, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù David mused, setting down yet another plate. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, offering a brief shrug. ‚ÄúYou cook well.‚Äù David chuckled softly. ‚ÄúYeah, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if you‚Äôd say that no matter what I made.‚Äù Eli smirked but said nothing, taking another bite. The kitchen grew quieter as the food disappeared, leaving behind only empty dishes and faint crumbs. Eli‚Äôs belly had become more noticeable by the time David set down the final serving‚Äîa loaf of bread and the last of the roasted vegetables. David watched carefully as Eli picked apart the bread, piece by piece, as though savoring the end of the meal. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs everything,‚Äù David said after a pause, glancing at the barren countertop. Eli sat back slightly, exhaling through his nose. His belly pressed against the table‚Äôs edge now, rounded subtly beneath the hoodie. David‚Äôs eyes lingered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I should be impressed or worried.‚Äù Eli chuckled softly, shifting in his seat. ‚ÄúI told you I could eat.‚Äù David nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, but I thought you‚Äôd hit a limit at some point.‚Äù Eli tilted his head, his gaze locking with David‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWho said I have?‚Äù The words hung in the air for a moment longer than David expected, and something about the way Eli said it felt almost like an invitation.

On the counter in front of him sat a burrito‚Äîenormous, easily the size of his forearm. David narrowed his eyes, expecting some kind of joke or trick. But Eli simply stretched his arms, rolled his shoulders, and leaned forward. Without hesitation, Eli opened his mouth‚Äîwide. Wider than David thought was physically possible.

David took a step back. ‚ÄúEli, that‚Äôs enough!‚Äù Still, Eli drank. His stomach surged forward, pushing the table further away with a dull screech as the legs gave way entirely. The table collapsed with a loud crash, sending silverware scattering across the floor. Eli‚Äôs belly surged into the space left behind, rolling over the broken wood like an unstoppable tide. David‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ seriously, stop!‚Äù Eli‚Äôs body lifted higher as his belly swelled, tilting his frame backward until his feet dangled inches off the ground. His hands clung to the edges of the counter, anchoring him in place as his midsection stretched forward, expanding into the empty air. The chairs splintered one by one, squeezed and flattened beneath the growing curve of his stomach. The countertop groaned as Eli‚Äôs belly began pressing into the cabinets, bending the wood with agonizing slowness. David retreated toward the living room, keeping his eyes locked on the expanding chaos. The kitchen filled with noises‚Äîdeep creaks, snapping wood, and the unsettling sound of metal warping as the cabinets buckled. Plates shattered beneath the weight, and the refrigerator door let out a pathetic whimper as it caved inward, vanishing under the mass of Eli‚Äôs stomach. By the time David reached the couch, Eli‚Äôs belly pressed against the edges of the kitchen doorway, straining to break free. The pale skin stretched tightly, glistening under the lights as it filled every inch of available space. David‚Äôs heart pounded. Eli groaned faintly, shifting slightly as his stomach inched further into the living room. The surface of Eli‚Äôs belly trembled. ‚ÄúEli‚Ä¶ I really think you should‚Äî‚Äù A loud creak interrupted him as the upper cabinets snapped from the walls, vanishing beneath the ever-expanding dome of Eli‚Äôs body. David pressed his back against the couch, staring in disbelief. Eli‚Äôs belly now filled the entire kitchen, pressing against walls, the ceiling, and the doorframe. It stretched like an overinflated balloon, and David swore he saw the color begin to change‚Äîdeepening to a faint pink, then to a worrying reddish hue. The sounds shifted, too. The soft creaks turned into groaning, high-pitched squeaks‚Äîlike a balloon seconds before bursting. David clenched his fists. ‚ÄúEli, I‚Äôm not cleaning this up if‚Äî‚Äù KRA-KRAAAKK! David winced as a large crack spiderwebbed across the far wall. The pressure was too much. Eli‚Äôs belly trembled, the taut skin vibrating as the creaks intensified, echoing like the last moments of a strained rubber band. ‚ÄúEli?‚Äù Eli‚Äôs hands twitched at the counter, but he didn‚Äôt stop. The reddish tint deepened. David took another step back, reaching for the door handle. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.‚Äù KAAA-THOOOOM!!! The explosion rocked the apartment. A massive tidal wave of water erupted from Eli‚Äôs belly, sweeping across the kitchen and flooding the entire living room. David was knocked off his feet, coughing and sputtering as he surfaced, now chest-deep in water. Dishes, splintered wood, and half-dissolved plastic fruit floated by as David treaded water, blinking in stunned silence. When the flood finally began to settle, David pulled himself onto the couch, water dripping from his clothes as he surveyed the damage. The kitchen was submerged. Eli was gone. David exhaled, dragging his hands down his face. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to explain this to the landlord.‚Äù","\n","^<strong>\"Congratulations!

The faint gurgling of water echoed through the quiet kitchen, but it wasn‚Äôt the sound that unsettled David‚Äîit was the sight before him. Eli‚Äôs stomach, already full and distended, swelled larger with each gulp. The round curve of his belly pressed harder against the counter, forcing Eli into an awkward lean as his midsection expanded outward, growing heavier with every passing second. The fabric of Eli‚Äôs hoodie stretched thin over the burgeoning mass, riding up further until the entire lower half of his belly was exposed. The pale skin glistened under the soft kitchen lights, pulled taut as his stomach bulged forward, rounding out like an inflating balloon. ‚ÄúEli,‚Äù David said, his voice laced with caution. ‚ÄúYou might want to slow down a bit.‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt respond. David stepped forward, his gaze fixed on the way Eli‚Äôs belly pressed deeper into the cabinets, creaking as it squeezed into the shrinking space. The round dome of his stomach began to lift him slightly, shifting his weight onto his toes as his body was gradually pushed upward. ‚ÄúEli, seriously,‚Äù David tried again, his nervous chuckle masking the growing concern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to flood yourself.‚Äù Still, Eli drank. His belly let out a low, deep groan as it stretched further, inching closer to the kitchen floor, expanding outward in every direction. The table‚Äôs edge creaked as it bent slightly beneath the pressure of Eli‚Äôs ballooning stomach. David‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúAlright‚Äîenough!‚Äù He lunged forward, grabbing Eli by the shoulders and pulling him back with a grunt. Eli‚Äôs grip on the faucet tightened, but David tugged harder, dragging him away until his mouth slipped from the stream of water. Eli stumbled, his belly sloshing heavily beneath him, wobbling as he steadied himself against the counter. David took a step back, panting lightly. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Eli blinked, as if just realizing where he was. His eyes flicked down to his bloated stomach, his hands instinctively resting atop the heavy curve. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Eli mumbled, rubbing slow circles over his distended belly. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Ä¶ zone out. It‚Äôs like a trance or something.‚Äù David‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúA trance?‚Äù Eli nodded, his palm gliding over the crest of his stomach. ‚ÄúIt happens when I eat or drink too much. I don‚Äôt really notice until someone snaps me out of it.‚Äù David‚Äôs gaze lingered on Eli‚Äôs belly, which visibly strained against his sweatpants, pressing far enough forward to rest on the tops of his thighs. ‚ÄúYeah, well‚Ä¶ you were about to turn into a water balloon.‚Äù Eli chuckled softly, shifting his weight as his belly let out a faint groan. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be the first time.‚Äù David sighed, shaking his head with a bemused smirk. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I stopped you.‚Äù Eli yawned, giving his belly a final pat. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll crash here tonight. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm rolling out of here any time soon.‚Äù David chuckled as he wiped down the now-damp counter. ‚ÄúYeah, I figured. I‚Äôll set up the couch.‚Äù As Eli waddled slowly toward the living room, David leaned against the counter, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order a grocery delivery for the morning,‚Äù David called out. ‚ÄúI have a feeling breakfast is going to be‚Ä¶ intense.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs voice drifted from the couch, muffled but amused. ‚ÄúGood call.‚Äù David flicked off the kitchen lights, leaving only the faint glow of the living room lamp. ‚ÄúNight, Eli.‚Äù ‚ÄúNight, David.‚Äù David lingered for a moment, watching Eli‚Äôs massive belly rise and fall as he stretched out on the couch.

Eli offered a slight nod, calmly reaching for the bread. Bite by bite, it disappeared in steady intervals. The bowl of vegetables followed next, each forkful vanishing until nothing remained but faint traces of oil at the bottom. David observed quietly, fascinated by how casual Eli remained. His belly, already visibly distended, pressed firmly into the table, but Eli continued as if unaware‚Äîor unbothered‚Äîby the gradual tightness forming beneath his hoodie. Even as the final scraps disappeared, Eli‚Äôs calm demeanor never wavered. ‚ÄúSure you‚Äôre not full yet?‚Äù David asked, raising an eyebrow. Eli patted his stomach lightly, the sound faintly muffled beneath the stretched fabric of his hoodie. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù David chuckled, shaking his head as he pushed back from the table. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm out of food, so I guess you‚Äôll have to make do.‚Äù Eli leaned back in his chair with a soft exhale, letting his hand rest atop his rounded belly. His hoodie had ridden up slightly, exposing just enough skin to reveal how tightly stretched his stomach had become. David couldn‚Äôt help but smirk. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre going to be able to sleep like that?‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes half-lidded as he shifted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage.‚Äù David stood, collecting the empty plates. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you do it.‚Äù Eli shrugged. ‚ÄúPractice.‚Äù David placed the dishes in the sink, glancing over his shoulder as Eli shifted, trying to find a comfortable position with his growing belly pinned against the table. The weight of it forced him to sit at an angle, and David could tell even standing up would require some effort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll set up the couch,‚Äù David said, drying his hands. ‚ÄúNo way you‚Äôre walking home tonight.‚Äù Eli smiled faintly. ‚ÄúAppreciate it.‚Äù David lingered by the doorway. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order groceries for the morning. Something tells me breakfast is going to be interesting.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes sparkled in amusement. ‚ÄúGood idea.‚Äù David flicked off the kitchen lights as Eli waddled slowly toward the living room, his belly rounding out further with each careful step. ‚ÄúNight, Eli.‚Äù ‚ÄúNight, David.‚Äù As David settled into his own room, he glanced once more toward the couch where Eli sprawled out, hands resting comfortably on his full stomach.

David‚Äôs eyes lingered, half-amused by how effortlessly Eli had devoured everything in the kitchen, but mostly intrigued by the way Eli sat, completely unbothered by the massive swell of his belly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to sleep like a rock tonight,‚Äù David joked, nudging Eli lightly with his elbow. Eli smirked, tilting his head to the side as his hand lazily rubbed over the firm curve of his midsection. ‚ÄúYeah, if I can get comfortable.‚Äù David chuckled, sinking deeper into the cushions. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll manage.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes drifted toward him, and for a moment, there was something unspoken in the air. His gaze softened, and David felt the faintest flutter in his chest. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù Eli said, voice low but inviting. He shifted slightly, patting the couch beside him. David hesitated briefly, but curiosity‚Äîand something else‚Äîdrew him in. He scooted closer, his thigh brushing lightly against Eli‚Äôs. Eli‚Äôs arm rested lazily over David‚Äôs shoulder, pulling him in just enough for their sides to press together. The warmth of Eli‚Äôs body radiated through the thin layer of his hoodie, and David could feel the subtle rise and fall of his chest beneath his palm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not too uncomfortable?‚Äù David asked, his hand hovering cautiously near Eli‚Äôs belly.

His tongue flicked out, wetting his lips, the playful smirk curling further as his hand traced along the curve of his distended stomach. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve still got room,‚Äù Eli murmured, his voice dropping just enough to make David‚Äôs skin prickle. David exhaled shakily. His pulse thrummed in his ears, and the space between them felt suffocating. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù David asked, though the answer was already clear. Eli didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù David‚Äôs hand hovered at his side, fingers twitching, uncertain whether to pull back or step forward. But something about the way Eli looked at him‚Äîlike David was already halfway down his throat‚Äîmade his heart race in ways he hadn‚Äôt expected.

David‚Äôs breath hitched. The warmth of Eli‚Äôs mouth made his skin tingle as his tongue traced along the curve of his calf, each motion sending electric sparks straight to his core. Eli‚Äôs lips stretched wider as he began to work his way up, the wet heat of his mouth swallowing David‚Äôs foot, his tongue curling around his ankle with teasing flicks. David‚Äôs chest rose and fell unevenly, his knuckles whitening against the counter. ‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù David breathed, his head tipping back slightly. Eli didn‚Äôt stop. His mouth slid further, enveloping David‚Äôs shin with agonizing slowness. David‚Äôs breath grew heavier, his arousal evident through his tightening pants.

The fabric of David‚Äôs pants stretched taut over his growing arousal, and Eli‚Äôs lips paused just long enough to press against the bulge forming there. David bit his lip, his head swimming in the sensation. The soft drag of Eli‚Äôs tongue against the outline of his erection sent heat rushing through him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop,‚Äù David whispered, his voice strained. Eli‚Äôs response was wordless, his mouth continuing its journey upward, swallowing David‚Äôs knee and sliding further past his thighs. David‚Äôs breath caught as Eli‚Äôs lips pressed firmly over the growing tightness in his pants, the sensation tipping him over the edge. His body trembled as the release washed over him, his fingers tangling briefly in Eli‚Äôs hair as he gasped softly. Eli hummed in approval, pausing just long enough to give David‚Äôs sensitive length a teasing flick with his tongue, savoring the reaction. As David‚Äôs pulse slowed, Eli pressed forward, pulling David‚Äôs hips deeper into his mouth. The stretch was slow, deliberate, and overwhelmingly intimate. By the time Eli‚Äôs lips reached his stomach, David could feel the outline of his legs curled inside the warmth of Eli‚Äôs body. His skin prickled with the surreal sensation of being enveloped, inch by inch, his arousal returning with every teasing flick of Eli‚Äôs tongue along his abdomen. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking your time,‚Äù David managed, his head tilting back against the counter. Eli‚Äôs eyes sparkled mischievously as he swallowed further, his lips pressing over David‚Äôs chest, leaving soft kisses along his ribs.

By the time Eli‚Äôs lips sealed over the curve of David‚Äôs chin, David felt weightless‚Äîhalf-dizzy from the rush of heat coursing through his veins. Eli gave one last slow, satisfied swallow, his belly rounding out even further as David curled into him fully. Eli stretched lazily, one hand resting against the massive curve of his stomach as he exhaled deeply. A faint groan of contentment escaped him as he sprawled back against the couch, his fingers tracing over the smooth, taut surface of his belly. ‚ÄúPerfect fit,‚Äù Eli murmured, gently patting the crest of his swollen midsection.

Eli‚Äôs tongue flicked expertly along his length, each movement slow and measured, as if savoring the moment. David‚Äôs fingers instinctively tangled in Eli‚Äôs hair, hips bucking gently into the warmth of Eli‚Äôs mouth. Eli took his time, teasing with long, deliberate strokes, his eyes flicking up to meet David‚Äôs whenever he moaned softly. The teasing only intensified as Eli‚Äôs lips tightened, drawing David deeper. David‚Äôs head tipped back against the couch, his body tensing as pleasure surged through him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm close‚Äî‚Äù David gasped, but Eli didn‚Äôt stop. Instead, he pressed further, swallowing David‚Äôs release with ease. Eli leaned back slowly, licking his lips with a satisfied hum. His hand drifted back to his belly, rubbing small circles as if to emphasize the fullness. David slumped against the couch, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was unexpected.‚Äù Eli chuckled, patting his swollen midsection. ‚ÄúTold you I could fit more.‚Äù David let out a breathless laugh, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre unbelievable.‚Äù Eli stretched lazily, settling further into the couch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that as a compliment.‚Äù David tugged a blanket over Eli, lingering for a moment as his hand drifted briefly over the curve of Eli‚Äôs belly one last time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order groceries in the morning,‚Äù David said, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need them.‚Äù Eli yawned, closing his eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to it.‚Äù David flicked off the lights, leaving Eli to drift into sleep.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Intro.theCouchDippedSl.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Next morning",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Intro.theCouchDippedSl.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Breakfast"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"Breakfast":[["^The soft glow of morning sunlight crept in through the half-closed blinds, casting long, warm streaks across the quiet apartment. The air was still, save for the faint hum of the fridge and the rhythmic ticking of a wall clock. David lay sprawled on his side, tangled in the sheets, his chest slowly rising and falling with each deep breath. Beside him, Eli lay curled beneath the thin blanket, his head buried into the pillow, soft hair falling messily over his face. The blanket draped loosely over Eli‚Äôs frame, the gentle curve of his stomach now flat and soft, a stark contrast to the enormous swell it had been the night before. His t-shirt clung lightly to his body, rising slightly with each slow exhale. The room was peaceful, the stillness punctuated only by the occasional faint gurgle from Eli‚Äôs belly, empty once again after burning through the mountain of food he had consumed. David shifted slightly in his sleep, his arm brushing lightly against Eli‚Äôs waist. Eli stirred just enough to nuzzle deeper into the pillow, his stomach letting out a faint growl in protest of its emptiness.

His stomach let out a low, impatient growl, and he stretched lazily in bed, running his hand over his flat stomach as if to soothe it. The smell was too tempting to ignore. Slipping out of bed, Eli padded toward the kitchen in just his loose t-shirt and boxers, yawning as he rubbed his eyes. As he entered, he spotted David at the stove, carefully flipping pancakes onto a growing stack. The table was already laid out‚Äîpiles of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, sausages, golden toast, buttered croissants, and even a few breakfast sandwiches. David glanced over his shoulder, smirking. \"Morning. I see your stomach‚Äôs already up.\" Eli chuckled, patting his exposed belly as it let out another loud grumble. \"Yeah‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm wasting away.\" He leaned against the counter, eyeing the feast hungrily. David grinned, his eyes lingering on Eli‚Äôs perfectly flat stomach. \"Hard to believe with that belly looking so empty. Sounds like it‚Äôs demanding a little attention.\" Eli stepped closer to the table, his eyes gleaming. \"It‚Äôs demanding a lot more than a little.\" Without waiting for an invitation, he grabbed an entire handful of bacon, stuffing several strips into his mouth at once. The crackling sound of the crispy bacon echoed as he chewed eagerly, barely swallowing before reaching for the croissants. He stacked two together, biting through both with a low moan. \"You could at least sit down,\" David teased, watching as Eli tore into a sandwich with one hand while shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth with the other. \"No time,\" Eli mumbled through a mouthful. \"I swear, I can feel myself shrinking.\" David laughed but couldn‚Äôt look away as Eli grabbed four pancakes at once, folding them over into a thick stack and stuffing them into his mouth. Syrup dripped down his chin as he chewed, his throat bobbing as he swallowed heavily. \"You‚Äôre going to choke if you keep eating like that,\" David said, setting down more sausages. Eli barely acknowledged him, now holding two breakfast sandwiches in one hand and biting through both simultaneously. He groaned in satisfaction as the food filled his stomach, his t-shirt beginning to ride up as his belly swelled from the sheer volume. David‚Äôs eyes followed the slow rise of Eli‚Äôs stomach, which now pressed gently against the waistband of his boxers. \"You know,\" David said as he brought another plate of pancakes over, \"if this isn‚Äôt enough, we could hit McDonald‚Äôs after. See if you can clear them out too.\" Eli grinned, his mouth full as he nodded eagerly. \"I like the sound of that,\" he said, barely pausing before reaching for the next plate. Halfway through the meal, Eli stood up and wandered to the fridge, his belly pushing slightly against his t-shirt as it hung heavier over his waistband. He yanked open the door, grabbed a gallon of orange juice, and twisted off the cap. Without bothering with a glass, he tilted the container back and began chugging. David‚Äôs eyes widened as Eli‚Äôs throat worked with each gulp, his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing. The plastic container slowly crumpled as the liquid disappeared. In seconds, the entire gallon was empty, and Eli let out a satisfied sigh, licking a drop of juice from his lips as he tossed the bottle into the recycling bin. \"Thirsty?\" David asked, smirking. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Barely touched it.\" By the time David sat down with his own plate of eggs, Eli had already finished off half the table. Without hesitation, Eli reached across, grabbed David‚Äôs plate, and dumped the entire serving of scrambled eggs directly into his mouth. David blinked. \"I was going to eat that.\" Eli shrugged, licking a smear of butter from his lips. \"I needed it more.\" David grabbed another platter, setting down the remaining croissants and sausages. Eli‚Äôs eyes lit up instantly. He piled four croissants into his hand, squeezing them together and shoving them into his mouth until his cheeks bulged. Crumbs scattered across the table as he chewed loudly, his stomach visibly rounding out under his shirt. As Eli leaned back for a brief moment, his belly pushed higher against the hem of his shirt, lifting it just enough to expose the lower curve of his now-taut stomach. His belly continued to swell with each bite, but there was no sign of him slowing down or reaching his limit. David‚Äôs gaze flickered to the exposed skin, watching in fascination as Eli grabbed another sandwich, tossing it back like it was nothing. When there was almost nothing left, Eli grabbed the bowl of fruit from the center of the table and sat back, letting his full belly settle. David watched, pulse quickening as Eli lifted an apple to his lips. Instead of biting into it, Eli opened his mouth wide, slowly swallowing the apple whole. His throat bulged slightly as the fruit slipped down, disappearing behind his collarbone. David shifted in his seat, his pants suddenly feeling uncomfortably tight. Eli met David‚Äôs gaze with a sly grin. \"You like that?\" David didn‚Äôt answer, too focused on the way Eli grabbed a whole orange next, peeling it with his teeth before pushing it into his mouth in one go. Finally, Eli reached for a banana, tossing it into his mouth‚Äîpeel and all‚Äîand swallowing with ease. David‚Äôs pulse throbbed visibly beneath his beltline, his arousal unmistakable. Eli leaned in closer, pressing his belly lightly against the table, letting the curve brush against David‚Äôs arm. \"So‚Ä¶ McDonald‚Äôs for round two, or should we take care of something else first?\" David swallowed hard, barely able to contain himself.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Take care of something else",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Drive to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theSoftMorningLi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliWokeToTheUnmi.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidJingledHisC"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theKitchenHummed":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The kitchen hummed softly with the comforting sizzle of bacon and the faint clink of a knife slicing through fresh bread. David moved with ease, layering cheese and ham onto the cutting board as the smell of buttered croissants filled the air. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the small mountain of breakfast ingredients he had lined up on the counter. Behind him, the soft padding of footsteps broke the quiet. David barely glanced back, catching sight of Eli shuffling into the kitchen, his loose t-shirt hanging lazily over his boxers. His hair was messy from sleep, and his eyes were still half-closed. Eli drifted to David‚Äôs side, his chin resting on David‚Äôs shoulder as he wrapped his arms around his waist from behind. His stomach, flat and soft, pressed lightly into David‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Eli mumbled against his neck, his lips grazing David‚Äôs skin. David smiled, flipping the bacon with practiced ease. ‚ÄúMorning. Figured I‚Äôd make us some sandwiches. Thought we could head to McDonald‚Äôs after if you‚Äôre still hungry.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs stomach growled loudly, rumbling between them. David chuckled. ‚ÄúGuess that‚Äôs a yes.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs hold tightened slightly, his fingers drifting over David‚Äôs hips. His breath was warm on David‚Äôs ear, sending faint shivers down his spine. ‚ÄúSmells good,‚Äù Eli murmured. ‚ÄúPatience,‚Äù David replied softly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost ready.‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt answer, but David could feel his gaze locked on the counter. His arms remained lazily wrapped around David, but there was a subtle tension in his body, like a cat watching prey. David felt Eli shift behind him, but before he could react, Eli‚Äôs hand slipped forward, snatching a slice of ham directly from the cutting board. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù David laughed, nudging him playfully with his elbow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the sandwiches.‚Äù Eli smirked around the mouthful, chewing slowly as if to savor the bite. ‚ÄúJust a taste,‚Äù he mumbled, reaching for another. David arched an eyebrow but kept slicing. ‚ÄúOne slice. Fine.‚Äù Eli pressed closer, his chin now resting on David‚Äôs shoulder as his eyes scanned the counter. His lips brushed lightly over David‚Äôs neck, soft kisses trailing lazily downward. David‚Äôs breath hitched slightly at the sensation, but he kept working, shaking his head with a small grin. Then, without warning, Eli reached across David‚Äôs chest, grabbing another handful of ham‚Äîthree slices this time‚Äîand shoving them into his mouth. ‚ÄúEli,‚Äù David warned, though his voice held more amusement than frustration. Eli grinned around the mouthful, his eyes glinting mischievously. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt help it,‚Äù he mumbled between bites, already eyeing the loaf of bread. Before David could stop him, Eli grabbed the entire loaf, tearing chunks directly from it and cramming them into his mouth in thick, greedy bites. Crumbs scattered across the counter as he devoured it, his cheeks puffed slightly as he swallowed down the dense bread without hesitation. David set the knife down, watching in stunned fascination as Eli reached for the carton of eggs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre eating those raw,‚Äù David said, half-laughing. Eli gave him a smug glance, lifting the carton with one hand. ‚ÄúWatch me.‚Äù Without cracking them, Eli tilted his head back, opening his mouth wide. He dumped three whole eggs directly in, the shells crunching audibly as he chewed, swallowing them with ease. David blinked. ‚ÄúYou could at least peel those.‚Äù Eli smirked, holding up the carton. ‚ÄúNah. Extra crunch.‚Äù David reached to take the carton from him, but Eli spun out of his grip, popping another handful into his mouth. The last few eggs disappeared, shells and all, leaving only the empty carton in his hands. David could barely react before Eli crumpled the carton and shoved it between his teeth, chewing loudly on the cardboard. David‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù Eli chewed through the carton as if it were nothing, swallowing the pieces with a satisfied sigh. His stomach let out a low gurgle, visibly rounding beneath his shirt. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious,‚Äù David muttered, watching as Eli grabbed the bananas next. Eli made deliberate eye contact as he peeled one halfway with his teeth, but instead of discarding the peel, he shoved the entire thing into his mouth, chewing slowly and deliberately. David‚Äôs hand trailed absentmindedly over Eli‚Äôs belly as it began to swell further beneath his shirt. The soft curve pressed into David‚Äôs palm, pushing outward with each bite Eli took. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really putting on a show,‚Äù David said, his voice dipping lower. Eli smirked as he grabbed a bunch of bananas, unpeeled, and stuffed two into his mouth simultaneously. His throat bobbed as he swallowed them whole, the bulge briefly visible before settling heavily in his stomach. David‚Äôs eyes trailed over Eli‚Äôs swelling belly, his hand drifting lower as he traced the edge of his stomach, feeling how firm it had grown beneath his touch. Eli reached for the pan of bacon, grabbing several sizzling strips directly from the heat. ‚ÄúEli!‚Äù David grabbed his wrist. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll burn yourself.‚Äù Eli chuckled, popping the bacon into his mouth, grease glistening on his lips. ‚ÄúWhat, you think this is the first time?‚Äù David couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. His hand drifted further down, pressing against Eli‚Äôs belly, which had grown rounder with each passing second. Eli grabbed the paper grocery bags next, tearing into the croissants, muffins, and waffles packed inside. He dumped an entire box of cereal directly into his mouth, swallowing dry flakes in large handfuls before moving on to the milk, which he chugged straight from the gallon. By the time Eli reached for the remaining bags, David‚Äôs breath hitched. His belly had grown so large that it pressed firmly into David‚Äôs side, warm and solid beneath his hands. David pressed his lips to Eli‚Äôs neck, exhaling softly. ‚ÄúYou ate everything.‚Äù Eli grinned, cramming the last of the paper bags into his mouth, swallowing them without hesitation. ‚ÄúI could still eat more.‚Äù David brushed his hand over Eli‚Äôs stomach, feeling the tightness beneath his fingers. ‚ÄúWe could go to McDonald‚Äôs now,‚Äù he suggested, voice low.

He stretched, his t-shirt riding up slightly as his hand brushed over the flat surface of his stomach, which growled faintly in protest. Blinking lazily, Eli glanced over at David, who hadn‚Äôt moved an inch. The doorbell rang again. Rubbing his eyes, Eli slipped out of bed, padding barefoot to the front door in nothing but his t-shirt and boxers. His belly remained taut and flat, a sharp contrast to how round and heavy it often ended up after meals. Another faint growl rumbled from it as Eli absentmindedly gave it a pat, yawning as he reached for the door handle. When Eli opened the door, a delivery man stood outside, shifting slightly under the weight of several large paper bags filled with groceries. ‚ÄúDelivery for David,‚Äù the courier said with a polite smile, glancing down at the clipboard in his hand.

A sudden, primal hunger flared in his stomach‚Äîa reflex he couldn‚Äôt ignore. His fingers stretched forward, curling around the ceramic pot as David‚Äôs grip tightened behind him. Without a second thought, Eli lifted the plant, tipping it toward his lips. David was too lost in the moment to notice at first. His breath grew ragged, his hips pressing harder against Eli‚Äôs. But as he opened his eyes, he caught the sight of Eli tilting his head back, the entire plant‚Äîpot, soil, and leaves‚Äîdisappearing into his mouth. Eli‚Äôs throat bobbed as he swallowed smoothly, his stomach expanding slightly against David‚Äôs touch as the pot settled inside.

With loud, satisfying cracks, the chicken disappeared, bones crunching effortlessly as he swallowed it down. Nothing remained but grease on his fingers, which he licked clean with a satisfied hum. Next, he pulled out the carton of eggs. Rather than cracking them, Eli tilted his head back and swallowed them whole, letting the smooth shells slide down his throat one by one. He grabbed the loaf of bread, ripping the entire thing in half and stuffing large chunks into his mouth, barely chewing before swallowing. His belly began to swell subtly, pushing against the fabric of his t-shirt, but Eli wasn‚Äôt slowing down. He popped open the syrup bottle and drank directly from it, thick sweetness coating his lips as he gulped greedily. The cereal followed, poured straight from the box into his mouth. When his throat dried, he grabbed the gallon of milk, tipping it back and drinking half the container in one go. Droplets ran down his chin and onto his shirt, but Eli didn‚Äôt care. He emptied the rest and tossed the carton aside, moving on to the juice. The gallon of orange juice disappeared just as quickly, his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing with each deep gulp. His belly visibly stretched as the liquid settled, rounding out further beneath his shirt. Next came the fruit pies. Eli stacked all three, shoving a quarter of the stack into his mouth and biting straight through the boxes. He swallowed thickly, barely bothering to pull away the packaging before finishing off the rest, licking stray crumbs from his fingers. His stomach rounded out even more, lifting the hem of his t-shirt to reveal smooth, taut skin underneath. Eli patted the growing dome, which now pressed firmly into the waistband of his boxers. Piling sausages into one hand, Eli shoveled them down with little effort, finishing the entire family pack in seconds. His belly let out a deep, satisfied gurgle, but his hunger lingered. His eyes drifted to the remaining grocery bags. Crumpling one in his hands, Eli hesitated for a moment before biting into it. The paper crinkled as he chewed lazily, swallowing the bag like an afterthought. He grabbed another, stuffing it halfway into his mouth when David‚Äôs groggy voice drifted from the hallway. ‚ÄúWas that the delivery?‚Äù Eli turned, mid-bite, the edge of the paper bag still hanging from his mouth. His belly pushed forward prominently, fully exposed beneath the bunched-up fabric of his shirt. David stood frozen in the doorway, wearing loose pajama bottoms and nothing else. His eyes trailed down Eli‚Äôs swollen stomach, and as his gaze dropped lower, the unmistakable bulge in his pants betrayed his reaction. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ eating the bags now?‚Äù David asked, stepping forward with a smirk. Eli swallowed the rest of the bag and shrugged. ‚ÄúFigured I‚Äôd clean up.‚Äù David‚Äôs eyes drifted back to the empty counter. ‚ÄúI see you left absolutely nothing for me.‚Äù He stepped closer, his hand resting on the firm curve of Eli‚Äôs belly, giving it a slow, deliberate rub. His fingers traced circles across the tight skin, feeling the faint gurgle beneath. Eli leaned into David‚Äôs touch, smirking down at him. ‚ÄúYou were sleeping. I didn‚Äôt want it to go cold.‚Äù David chuckled softly, his hand lingering on Eli‚Äôs stomach. ‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre still hungry‚Ä¶ we could hit McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù His palm pressed more firmly against Eli‚Äôs belly, letting it push into him. ‚ÄúOr we could stay here and deal with‚Ä¶ something else.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes darkened slightly, his belly pressing harder into David‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI like the sound of both.‚Äù David‚Äôs arousal was undeniable now, his pajama bottoms doing little to hide it. Eli‚Äôs gaze dropped down, smirking knowingly.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Deal with something else",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theSoftMorningLi"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.eliAcceptedTheHe.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidJingledHisC"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliAcceptedTheHe1":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli accepted the heavy bags from the courier, but as his stomach gave another loud growl, his eyes lingered on the man standing at the door. The courier shifted slightly under Eli‚Äôs gaze, unaware of the hunger burning behind his casual smile. ‚ÄúThat everything?‚Äù Eli asked, adjusting the bags in his arms. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the courier replied, glancing down at the clipboard. ‚ÄúBig order today. Someone must be planning a feast.‚Äù Eli smirked. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ something like that.‚Äù His stomach rumbled again, louder this time, and Eli‚Äôs eyes flicked down toward the remaining bags still in the courier‚Äôs hands. But something else caught his attention‚Äîthe courier‚Äôs sturdy build, broad shoulders, and thick arms. Eli‚Äôs gaze lingered on him a little too long. The courier, sensing the stare, chuckled nervously. ‚ÄúWell, enjoy your meal.‚Äù But before he could turn away, Eli‚Äôs stomach let out a deep, impatient growl, louder than before. The sound seemed to echo in the hallway, and Eli tilted his head slightly, his grip tightening on the bags. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli‚Äôs voice dropped, his smile shifting into something a little more predatory. ‚ÄúYou might as well come in.‚Äù The courier hesitated for just a moment, caught off guard by the sudden shift in Eli‚Äôs tone. But Eli stepped aside, gesturing inside with a casual wave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big delivery. Could use a hand unpacking,‚Äù Eli added, his eyes narrowing slightly. Reluctantly, the courier stepped inside, setting the remaining bags on the counter. ‚ÄúAlright, I guess I have a minute.‚Äù Eli closed the door softly behind him, locking it with a quiet click. As the courier began unpacking the bags, Eli set his own down, watching silently as the man pulled out groceries one by one. His stomach gurgled again, and this time the courier glanced over his shoulder. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre hungry,‚Äù he said with a chuckle. Eli grinned, stepping closer. ‚ÄúYou have no idea.‚Äù Before the courier could react, Eli‚Äôs hands were on him, pushing him gently but firmly against the counter. The man barely had time to gasp as Eli leaned in, his mouth opening wide‚Äîmuch wider than seemed possible. The courier‚Äôs eyes widened in shock as Eli‚Äôs lips stretched over his shoulders, and with surprising ease, Eli began to swallow him whole. The man squirmed slightly, but Eli‚Äôs grip held firm, his throat bulging as the courier‚Äôs upper body slid deeper inside. Bit by bit, Eli worked him down, his belly expanding with each gulp. The courier‚Äôs legs kicked faintly as they disappeared past Eli‚Äôs lips, his shoes falling to the floor with a soft thud. Eli‚Äôs throat finally settled, and with one last powerful swallow, the courier was gone. Eli leaned against the counter, panting softly as his belly stretched out in front of him, pressing tightly against his shirt and forcing it to ride up over the firm, swollen dome. But he wasn‚Äôt finished. Eli‚Äôs gaze drifted toward the bags of groceries sitting on the counter. Without even bothering to unpack them, he grabbed the first bag by the handles and lifted it to his mouth. Tilting his head back, he let the entire bag slide down, groceries and all. The plastic crinkled as it disappeared past his lips, leaving nothing but empty air in its place. One by one, the remaining bags followed. Bottles of milk, cartons of eggs, bread, fruit, packaged meat‚Äîeverything slid effortlessly into Eli‚Äôs stomach, the plastic bags vanishing with soft gulps. His belly stretched even further, rounding out heavily beneath his tight shirt, which now barely covered the top half of his swollen stomach. David‚Äôs voice called from the hallway, still groggy from sleep. ‚ÄúWas that the delivery?‚Äù Eli turned, mid-swallow, as the last bag slipped past his lips. His belly gurgled loudly, rounding out to an almost exaggerated size, pressing firmly into the counter as he leaned back with a satisfied sigh. David appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes, but the moment his gaze locked onto Eli, he froze. His jaw dropped as he took in the sight of Eli‚Äôs massive, bloated belly and the empty kitchen, save for a single pair of shoes by the door. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ the hell happened?‚Äù David‚Äôs voice cracked, eyes wide as he stared at Eli in disbelief. Eli smirked, patting the curve of his belly. ‚ÄúTook care of the delivery.‚Äù David stepped forward slowly, his eyes flicking between Eli‚Äôs stomach and the shoes near the door. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ You ate the courier?‚Äù Eli‚Äôs grin widened. ‚ÄúYeah. And the groceries. Didn‚Äôt even have to unpack them.‚Äù David‚Äôs gaze lingered on Eli‚Äôs belly, which shifted slightly as something inside moved. His eyes widened even further, his hand instinctively reaching out to press gently against the stretched skin. ‚ÄúJesus, Eli‚Ä¶ I can feel him moving in there,‚Äù David muttered, his voice laced with disbelief. His other hand drifted lower, brushing over the soft, warm curve of Eli‚Äôs swollen stomach. The movement beneath David‚Äôs palm was faint but unmistakable, causing David‚Äôs breath to hitch. Eli leaned into his touch, smirking knowingly. ‚ÄúGuess he‚Äôs getting comfortable.‚Äù David exhaled sharply, his fingers tracing slow circles over Eli‚Äôs belly. ‚ÄúI was planning to take you to McDonald‚Äôs for breakfast‚Ä¶ but after this, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll even fit in the car.‚Äù Eli chuckled. ‚ÄúI could still eat.‚Äù David‚Äôs arousal was undeniable now, his pajama bottoms doing little to hide it.

His other hand drifted lower, grazing along the tight waistband of Eli‚Äôs boxers, his arousal pressing firmly against the soft fabric of his pajama bottoms. Eli smirked, catching the hungry look in David‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúI guess you like me even more when I‚Äôm stuffed.‚Äù David swallowed, his fingers tracing slow circles over the firm curve of Eli‚Äôs belly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre impossible to resist like this.‚Äù Eli leaned closer, his swollen stomach brushing heavily against David‚Äôs hips, pressing into him like a soft, overfilled cushion. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not full yet,‚Äù Eli teased, his voice low and inviting. David shivered under Eli‚Äôs touch, but as he pressed closer, the sheer size of Eli‚Äôs rounded belly created an obstacle between them. David‚Äôs hips pressed against the curve, but it was impossible to get any closer without Eli‚Äôs stomach pushing him back. Eli laughed softly, realizing the situation. ‚ÄúI guess this thing‚Äôs in the way,‚Äù he said, giving his belly a playful pat. David grinned, brushing his lips over Eli‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not complaining.‚Äù With a sly smile, Eli knelt down on the kitchen floor, adjusting his position as his belly pressed heavily against the ground. Slowly, he shifted his weight forward, letting his massive stomach spread out beneath him like an oversized cushion. As his belly expanded, Eli tipped forward even further, his legs lifting off the ground as he stretched out horizontally across the swell. It was like lying on a giant beanbag, his body balanced on top of his overfilled stomach, which now pressed firmly into the cool tile of the kitchen floor. His arms rested in front of him while his legs kicked faintly in the air, his belly beneath him holding him aloft. Eli glanced back at David, smirking. ‚ÄúProblem solved. Now come over here.‚Äù David knelt behind him, running his hands over the broad curve of Eli‚Äôs belly, feeling the warmth radiating from his skin. He pressed against it gently, marveling at how soft yet firm it felt beneath his palms. Eli‚Äôs belly gurgled faintly, shifting slightly under David‚Äôs touch. ‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù Eli teased, glancing back over his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou might pop me.‚Äù David chuckled, leaning in to kiss the exposed stretch of skin just above Eli‚Äôs waistband. ‚ÄúI doubt that,‚Äù he murmured, his arousal pressing firmly against Eli‚Äôs belly as he moved closer. Eli shifted slightly, grinding back against David, but the weight of his own stomach made any movement slow and deliberate. David‚Äôs breath hitched as Eli‚Äôs hands slid down, tugging David‚Äôs pajama bottoms down and letting his arousal spring free. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre practically bursting,‚Äù Eli said with a grin, licking his lips. David barely had time to react before Eli leaned forward, taking him fully into his mouth with a slow, teasing motion. David groaned, his hands gripping Eli‚Äôs hips as he pressed deeper into the warm, wet heat of Eli‚Äôs mouth. Eli‚Äôs belly shifted beneath him as he bobbed his head, the soft creaks of the kitchen floor mixing with David‚Äôs breathy gasps. David could feel the weight of Eli‚Äôs belly pressing back into his thighs, creating an overwhelming sensation as Eli‚Äôs mouth worked him over with deliberate, hungry movements. David‚Äôs grip on Eli‚Äôs hips tightened, but Eli didn‚Äôt slow down. His lips glided effortlessly along David‚Äôs length, taking him deep with each motion, until David felt the pressure building rapidly inside him. Eli‚Äôs pace quickened, his throat flexing as David‚Äôs hips twitched beneath him. David gasped sharply, his climax hitting harder and faster than he expected. But Eli didn‚Äôt stop‚Äîhis mouth stayed firmly around David as he swallowed everything David had to give. The intensity of the release caught David off guard, and his knees buckled slightly as wave after wave surged through him. Eli‚Äôs throat worked greedily, each gulp causing his belly to swell slightly larger, rounding out just a bit more beneath him. David‚Äôs climax lasted longer than either of them anticipated, and by the time Eli finally pulled back, his belly had expanded just enough to lift him even higher off the ground. David collapsed onto his knees, panting heavily, his hands resting on Eli‚Äôs bloated belly. His fingers traced soft circles over the stretched skin, feeling the faint warmth beneath them. Eli licked his lips, patting his belly with a satisfied sigh. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting that much,‚Äù he teased, shifting slightly on top of his stomach. ‚ÄúI think you pumped me up more than breakfast did.‚Äù David chuckled breathlessly, leaning down to kiss Eli‚Äôs lower back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good at this,‚Äù he murmured. Eli grinned, resting his chin on his hands as he sprawled out on his belly. ‚ÄúI aim to please.‚Äù David slid his hand further down, squeezing the soft curve of Eli‚Äôs waist. ‚ÄúI was thinking about taking you to McDonald‚Äôs after breakfast,‚Äù he said with a smirk. ‚ÄúBut now I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll even fit through the door.‚Äù Eli laughed, rocking back and forth slightly on his belly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it fit,‚Äù he replied playfully. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre up for another round, I wouldn‚Äôt mind staying right here a little longer.‚Äù David‚Äôs eyes darkened with interest, his hand trailing up Eli‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a minute to rest first. Then we‚Äôll see if you can handle more.‚Äù Eli grinned. ‚ÄúI can always handle more.‚Äù They stayed there for a moment longer, David‚Äôs hands never leaving Eli‚Äôs belly, until eventually, they pulled themselves together and headed out for another meal.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidsHandLinger.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to McDonald's",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Breakfast.davidsHandLinger.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.afterCatchingThe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"afterCatchingThe":[["^After catching their breath and sharing a few lingering touches, David and Eli finally pulled themselves together. Eli adjusted his t-shirt, though it did little to cover his still-swollen belly, which jutted out proudly beneath the stretched fabric. David tugged on a pair of sweatpants and grabbed his keys from the counter. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù David said, smirking as he ran his hand over Eli‚Äôs belly one last time, ‚ÄúI guess you can still fit a few McMuffins in there.‚Äù Eli patted his stomach, making it jiggle slightly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always room for more,‚Äù he replied with a grin. David chuckled and opened the front door, stepping out into the cool morning air. But as he took another step forward, he stopped abruptly, nearly bumping into Eli, who had followed closely behind.

David pulled the courier‚Äôs car around the block, parking it on a quiet side street out of view. He left the keys on the dashboard, casually locking the door behind him. As David approached his own car, he found Eli leaning heavily against the passenger door, arms folded over the top of his round belly. His shirt had ridden up even more, exposing a wide stretch of taut skin beneath the hem. Eli glanced at David with a smirk. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ we might have a slight problem.‚Äù David raised an eyebrow, trying not to laugh as he took in the sight. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt squeeze in?‚Äù Eli grinned, shifting slightly as his belly pressed against the door. ‚ÄúNot easily.‚Äù David walked around, opening the passenger door wide. Eli carefully angled himself, turning sideways to ease his belly into the seat. The steering wheel creaked softly as David watched Eli shift and adjust until he was finally wedged in, his belly partially resting against the dashboard. ‚ÄúThere.

By the time they arrived, the parking lot was mostly empty, save for a few early risers grabbing breakfast. David parked near the entrance, cutting the engine as he turned to Eli. ‚ÄúYou sure you want to go inside like this?‚Äù David teased, eyeing Eli‚Äôs protruding belly. Eli opened the door carefully, using both hands to guide his belly as he eased out of the car. ‚ÄúOf course. I need to stretch before round two.‚Äù David shook his head, unable to hide his grin as Eli straightened, his belly leading the way toward the entrance. As they approached the glass doors, David‚Äôs hand drifted instinctively to Eli‚Äôs lower back, his palm resting just above the swell of his belly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if McDonald‚Äôs is ready for you,‚Äù David murmured playfully.

Eli circled it once, eyeing it as if sizing up the challenge. His hands rested on his hips, thumbs brushing the swell of his exposed belly as his t-shirt rode up even further. ‚ÄúEli‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a car. Not a sandwich,‚Äù David said, following cautiously. Eli shot him a look, grinning. ‚ÄúYou know better than anyone I don‚Äôt really have limits.‚Äù Before David could respond, Eli pressed his hands against the hood of the car, bending forward slightly. His stomach squished lightly against the metal as he opened his mouth unnaturally wide, his jaw stretching in that impossible way David was still getting used to. David‚Äôs heart raced as Eli‚Äôs lips wrapped around the front of the car. With a deep, slow inhale, Eli began to pull the vehicle forward, his mouth sliding further over the hood. Inch by inch, the car crept inside Eli‚Äôs expanding maw, his throat bulging as the front wheels lifted slightly off the ground. David watched in stunned silence as Eli steadily swallowed the car, tilting his head back to let it slide further down. His belly surged outward, pressing harder into the pavement as more of the car disappeared from sight. The soft crunch of metal echoed faintly as Eli‚Äôs stomach stretched larger, rounding out and pressing heavily against the ground beneath him. By the time the back wheels left the pavement, David could hardly believe his eyes. The entire vehicle slipped past Eli‚Äôs lips, and with a final gulp, it was gone. Eli leaned back with a deep exhale, his swollen belly now dominating his frame, pressed firmly against the ground like an overfilled balloon. David stared in disbelief, his mouth slightly open as he tried to form words. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you just ate a car.‚Äù Eli grinned, patting the massive curve of his stomach. ‚ÄúTold you I could handle it.‚Äù David approached slowly, pressing his hands against Eli‚Äôs belly.

David stepped back slightly, watching as a faint warmth seemed to radiate from Eli‚Äôs body. His stomach began to shrink, the massive dome deflating rapidly, the outline of the car fading as his belly returned to its normal, flat state. The entire process took less than a minute, and by the end, Eli was panting softly, wiping sweat from his brow. David stepped closer, running his hands over Eli‚Äôs stomach, now perfectly flat as if nothing had happened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ insane,‚Äù David muttered, completely fascinated. Eli grinned weakly, leaning against David for support. ‚ÄúTold you. But now I‚Äôm starving.‚Äù David chuckled, wrapping an arm around Eli‚Äôs waist. ‚ÄúAlright.

David walked beside him, suppressing a grin as customers and staff alike shot furtive glances in Eli‚Äôs direction. The cashier at the front counter paused mid-sentence, his eyes slowly widening as Eli waddled forward, his belly lightly bumping against the counter with a soft thud. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Eli greeted with a lazy grin, rubbing the crest of his belly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take‚Ä¶‚Äù He squinted up at the menu, tilting his head thoughtfully. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with five Big Macs, three double quarter-pounders, four large fries, thirty nuggets, two twenty-piece McNugget boxes, six apple pies, four milkshakes‚Äîvanilla and chocolate‚Äîand‚Ä¶ a family-size chicken bucket.

David swirled the last of his drink, grinning as he watched Eli pat his stomach contentedly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve eaten more than the entire breakfast rush,‚Äù David teased. Eli smirked, leaning forward slightly as his stomach let out a soft gurgle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just warming up,‚Äù he replied.

He barked orders to the kitchen staff, who scrambled into action, trays of food starting to appear at the counter within minutes. Eli‚Äôs grin widened as the first wave arrived‚Äîstacked burgers, large boxes of fries, and trays of golden nuggets. He wasted no time, grabbing two burgers at once and shoving them into his mouth. The wrappers crinkled in his hands as he swallowed thick gulps, barely pausing to breathe before moving to the next item. David watched, amused, as Eli devoured tray after tray with ease. Burgers vanished in seconds, fries disappeared by the handful, and nuggets were tossed back like candy. Eli‚Äôs appetite only seemed to grow, his stomach swelling further with each bite. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a black hole,‚Äù David teased, his hand brushing against Eli‚Äôs belly. Eli grinned between bites, his voice muffled by food. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve only seen half of it.‚Äù The next wave arrived‚Äîbreakfast items mixed with desserts. Pancakes dripping in syrup, cinnamon rolls, and pies piled high on a tray. Eli‚Äôs eyes lit up as he grabbed a stack of pancakes, folding them into a sandwich and shoving them into his mouth. Syrup dripped down his chin as he chewed, his throat bobbing with each massive swallow. Customers in the dining area stared in disbelief, some whispering, others pulling out their phones to record the spectacle. A few had already abandoned their meals, leaving half-eaten trays behind. As Eli moved on to the desserts, he reached for the pies, devouring them whole, crust and all. McFlurries were tilted back and gulped like drinks, the thick ice cream disappearing in seconds. A stack of cookies followed, crushed into a single ball before being stuffed into his mouth. His belly swelled larger, pressing into the table with enough force to make it creak. David shifted slightly, giving Eli more room as his stomach pushed outward, firm and round beneath his stretched shirt. ‚ÄúStill going?‚Äù David asked, his voice light with amusement. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, already grabbing the next tray. ‚ÄúThey better not stop,‚Äù he said, his tone playful but firm. By the time the final trays were cleared, Eli leaned back with a heavy sigh, his hands resting on the enormous curve of his belly. The table in front of him was a wasteland of empty containers, and the staff behind the counter stood frozen, watching in stunned silence.

No holding back.‚Äù The next wave arrived‚Äîfamily-sized fries, large sodas, and desserts.

His stomach began to swell visibly, pressing further into the table with each tray. The bolts anchoring the table to the floor started to groan under the strain. The staff continued to bring out food as fast as they could prepare it, their faces growing more pale with each trip. Soon, the trays included breakfast items‚Äîpancakes dripping with syrup, stacks of cinnamon rolls, and platters of scrambled eggs. Eli devoured them all, syrup dripping down his chin as he licked his lips. By the time the final trays were cleared, Eli leaned back with a deep sigh. His belly was enormous, stretching far out in front of him, pressing heavily into the now-tilted table. The bolts gave one last groan before snapping with a loud crack. The table toppled forward, but Eli‚Äôs stomach rolled over it, crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, shaking his head as he rested his hand on Eli‚Äôs taut, swollen stomach. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve officially eaten them out of business.‚Äù Eli smirked, patting his belly proudly. ‚ÄúTold you I could.‚Äù The manager and staff stood frozen near the counter, their faces pale as they whispered nervously among themselves. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eaten everything,‚Äù one of them said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúThe kitchen, the storage‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got nothing left.‚Äù The fry cook, still clutching a spatula, shook his head. ‚ÄúThis is insane.

Eli shrugged, swallowing another mouthful. ‚ÄúFood‚Äôs food.‚Äù The next tray arrived‚Äîa stack of gallon jugs filled with cooking oil. Eli lifted one, twisting off the cap and tilting it back like a bottle of soda. The thick liquid sloshed down his throat, disappearing quickly as Eli set the empty jug aside and reached for another. David raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drinking oil now?‚Äù Eli chuckled, gulping down another jug. ‚ÄúAdds flavor.‚Äù The staff continued unloading more supplies‚Äîbags of frozen fries, containers of sauce, and trays of uncooked nuggets. Eli tore through them all, the bags ripping open in his hands as he shoved handfuls of fries into his mouth. The frozen nuggets were tossed back like candy, and even the sauce packets weren‚Äôt spared, their contents squeezed directly onto his tongue. With every bite, Eli‚Äôs belly swelled larger, pressing harder into the table until it began to groan under the strain. David shifted in his seat as the table tilted slightly forward. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to break this thing,‚Äù David said, half-laughing, his hand tracing the curve of Eli‚Äôs stomach. Eli grinned. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be the first time.‚Äù As the last of the raw ingredients disappeared, Eli leaned back with a satisfied sigh, his belly now rounding out so far that it completely filled the space between the booth and the table. But he wasn‚Äôt done yet. His eyes flicked toward the manager, who stood frozen by the counter. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Eli said, his voice firm. ‚ÄúWhat else have you got?‚Äù The manager blinked. ‚ÄúW-What else?‚Äù Eli nodded toward the storage door. ‚ÄúBring me everything.

Napkins followed next, dozens at a time, disappearing in thick gulps. David watched in amazement as Eli worked through the next wave of supplies. Cardboard boxes were torn open, their contents devoured along with the packaging. Cups were stacked together and shoved into Eli‚Äôs mouth, disappearing in one long swallow. Straws and plastic lids vanished by the handful, adding to the growing bulk in his stomach. By the time the final tray of supplies was gone, Eli‚Äôs belly had grown so large that it completely overtook the booth. The table groaned louder, tilting dangerously forward before the bolts anchoring it to the floor gave way with a loud snap. The table crashed to the ground, but Eli‚Äôs stomach didn‚Äôt stop. It surged forward, rolling over the fallen table and crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, leaning back to avoid the expanding dome. ‚ÄúYou just destroyed their furniture.‚Äù Eli smirked, patting his stomach proudly. ‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt make them so flimsy.‚Äù The staff stood frozen, staring at the destruction as Eli leaned back with a deep sigh, his hands resting on the taut, heaving surface of his belly.

This time, he didn‚Äôt bother sorting through it‚Äîhe simply grabbed the entire bag and tipped its contents into his mouth. Fries, nuggets, and even sauce packets tumbled in, vanishing rapidly. His belly groaned in response, pressing harder into the table as it expanded further. The second bag emptied, Eli leaned back with a sigh, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. But his hunger wasn‚Äôt sated. His eyes flicked toward the dining area, where a few brave customers remained seated, clutching their trays nervously. Scattered across the room were abandoned trays piled with leftover meals. Eli‚Äôs grin returned, more mischievous than ever. He sat up straighter, his belly shifting forward with a deep, audible groan as it brushed against the edge of the table. ‚ÄúAlright, listen up!‚Äù Eli‚Äôs voice boomed across the restaurant, causing every head to snap toward him. He gestured to the customers, pointing directly at his massive stomach. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to end up in here‚Äù‚Äîhe slapped the crest of his belly for emphasis‚Äî‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to grab every tray, every scrap of food, and bring it over to me. And don‚Äôt just set it down‚Äîdump it straight into my mouth.‚Äù The room fell silent for a moment. Then, one by one, the terrified customers scrambled to obey. They grabbed their trays and hurried toward Eli, trembling as they approached the booth. Eli leaned forward, his belly pressing even harder against the table as he opened his mouth wide‚Äîunnaturally wide. The customers hesitated only briefly before tipping their trays into his waiting jaws. Burgers, fries, drinks, and desserts slid directly into his mouth, disappearing in seconds as he swallowed effortlessly. ‚ÄúFaster!‚Äù Eli commanded, his voice booming as he pointed toward the remaining abandoned trays. The customers moved more quickly now, rushing to collect every last scrap of food in the dining area. One by one, they poured their trays into Eli‚Äôs open mouth, the sounds of gulping and chewing echoing throughout the restaurant. David leaned back, smirking as he watched the spectacle unfold. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got them well-trained,‚Äù he teased, his hand tracing lazy circles over the growing dome of Eli‚Äôs stomach. Eli chuckled, his throat bobbing with another massive gulp. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre learning fast.‚Äù By the time the final tray was emptied, Eli slumped back into the booth, letting out a long, satisfied sigh. His belly had grown so large that it completely overtook the space between the booth and the table. The bolts anchoring the table to the floor creaked loudly before finally snapping with a deafening crack. The table toppled forward, but Eli‚Äôs stomach surged over it, pinning it to the ground and crushing it flat with a loud crunch. David laughed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou really know how to make an impression.‚Äù Eli smirked, patting the tight, round curve of his belly. His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his swollen stomach fully exposed. Just then, the manager approached cautiously, his face pale and his hands trembling. ‚ÄúS-Sir,‚Äù he stammered, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing left. You‚Äôve eaten everything‚Äîthe trays, the scraps, the leftovers. The restaurant is‚Ä¶ empty.‚Äù Eli tilted his head back, rubbing his stomach contentedly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs disappointing,‚Äù he said lazily. ‚ÄúI was just getting started.‚Äù Eli leaned back heavily into the booth, his enormous belly dominating the space around him. It pressed firmly against the crushed remains of the table and spilled out onto the floor, stretching taut and round like an overinflated balloon. His hands rubbed slow circles over the bulging surface, his face a picture of contentment.The staff huddled nervously by the counter, too afraid to move, while David sat beside Eli, smirking as he traced the curve of Eli‚Äôs stomach with his fingers.‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù David said, leaning forward, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time we get you home.‚ÄùEli chuckled, shifting slightly, but his belly barely budged. ‚ÄúYeah, about that,‚Äù he said, his tone dry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I can even stand up right now.‚ÄùDavid raised an eyebrow, glancing down at the massive dome that had Eli completely pinned in place. His belly groaned audibly, pressing against the edges of the booth and leaving no room for movement.‚ÄúWell,‚Äù David said with a grin, ‚Äúthis is a problem.‚ÄùEli sighed, rubbing his stomach. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say.‚ÄùDavid stood, inspecting the situation as he walked around the booth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wedged in there pretty good,‚Äù he observed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely not getting you into the car like this.‚ÄùEli gave him a pointed look. ‚ÄúThanks for the vote of confidence.‚ÄùDavid laughed, tapping his chin thoughtfully. ‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôve got two options. You could activate your metabolism and burn through this‚Ä¶ but I know how much you hate doing that.‚ÄùEli groaned, tilting his head back against the booth. ‚ÄúYou know it drains me completely. What‚Äôs the second option?‚ÄùDavid smirked. ‚ÄúI could call a friend with a crane.‚ÄùEli blinked, staring at him for a moment before bursting into laughter, his belly jiggling slightly from the motion. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚ÄùDavid shrugged. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a better idea?‚ÄùEli‚Äôs laughter faded as he considered the situation.

Maybe we should go together‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the manager interrupted, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúIf we all go, it‚Äôll look like we‚Äôre threatening him.

He leaned lazily against the booth, patting the rounded dome of his stomach as it groaned faintly. David sat across from him, casually swirling his drink. ‚ÄúLooks like someone‚Äôs finally working up the courage to talk to you,‚Äù he said, smirking. Eli chuckled, wiping a crumb from his lip. ‚ÄúAbout time.‚Äù The manager approached cautiously, his hands shaking as he stepped closer. Eli‚Äôs gaze turned toward him, his sharp eyes glinting with amusement as he tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ s-sir,‚Äù the manager stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI need to ask you to‚Ä¶ to leave.

His jaw stretched unnaturally wide, and with one swift motion, he engulfed the manager‚Äôs head and upper body. The room erupted in panicked gasps. The staff behind the counter froze in horror, watching as Eli tilted his head back, pulling the struggling manager deeper into his mouth. ‚ÄúEli!‚Äù David called out, half-laughing. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt even give the guy a warning?‚Äù Eli grunted, his throat bulging as the manager slid further down. His legs kicked briefly before vanishing completely with a loud gulp. Eli leaned back, patting his belly as it swelled slightly larger, groaning audibly as it adjusted to the new occupant. The cashier let out a scream, breaking the silence. ‚ÄúH-He ate him!‚Äù The fry cook dropped his spatula, his hands clenching into fists. ‚ÄúWe have to do something!‚Äù Three employees rushed toward Eli, one grabbing his arm while the others pulled at his stomach, shouting frantically. ‚ÄúSpit him out!‚Äù one yelled, yanking at Eli‚Äôs wrist. Eli smirked, his body unmoving as if their efforts were nothing. ‚ÄúYou really think that‚Äôs gonna work?‚Äù With a sudden, fluid motion, Eli lunged forward, grabbing two of the employees by their collars. The third stumbled backward, but not before Eli opened his mouth again, swallowing all three in rapid succession. Their muffled shouts faded as his throat bulged with their forms, and his stomach expanded further, pressing heavily into the booth and floor. David stood casually, watching the chaos unfold. With a swift motion, he grabbed a nearby table and dragged it in front of the door, blocking the exit. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt have anyone running off now,‚Äù David said with a grin, dusting his hands. The remaining staff and a few terrified customers tried to scatter, but Eli was already moving. His belly sloshed audibly as he stood, his massive frame towering over the room. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Eli said, his voice booming, ‚Äútime to finish this.‚Äù One by one, Eli grabbed the remaining staff, swallowing them with ease. Their panicked screams were short-lived as they disappeared into his ever-growing belly, which groaned and stretched further with each gulp. The customers weren‚Äôt spared either. Those who hadn‚Äôt already fled found themselves cornered, their trays and meals abandoned as Eli approached. His jaws stretched wide, devouring them in groups until the restaurant was completely silent. David leaned against the counter, watching Eli slouch back into the booth, his belly now so massive it spilled across the floor, leaving him pinned in place. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù David said, patting the crest of Eli‚Äôs stomach, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs one way to deal with customer service complaints.‚Äù Eli chuckled breathlessly, his hands rubbing slow circles over his swollen belly. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt complain if they‚Äôre inside me.‚Äù David laughed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúAlright, big guy.

The others followed suit, pulling at Eli‚Äôs arms and stomach, shouting frantically. But Eli didn‚Äôt slow down. With a powerful gulp, the fry cook disappeared entirely, his muffled shouts fading as Eli‚Äôs throat bulged briefly before his stomach swelled larger.

A custom-built truck rolled into view, its reinforced sides gleaming under the streetlights. The truck bed was equipped with a hydraulic lift and platform, clearly built for heavy loads.The driver, a burly man with a thick beard and an amused grin, climbed out of the cab. He took one look at Eli and let out a low whistle.‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù he said, clapping him on the shoulder, ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt kidding. That‚Äôs one hell of a belly.‚ÄùEli smirked from his position in the booth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all hard work, my friend.‚ÄùThe driver chuckled, walking closer to get a better look. ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you eat?‚ÄùDavid shook his head. ‚ÄúEverything. Twice.‚ÄùThe driver laughed, shaking his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôve hauled some heavy stuff in my day, but this is definitely a first.‚ÄùGetting Eli onto the truck was no easy feat. The hydraulic lift creaked under his weight as he waddled onto the platform, his enormous belly swaying heavily with each step. The driver worked the controls carefully, lifting Eli onto the reinforced truck bed as David secured him with thick industrial straps.‚ÄúThink these will hold?‚Äù David asked, tightening the last strap.The driver grinned. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre rated for heavy machinery. If these can‚Äôt hold him, nothing will.‚ÄùEli leaned back, his hands resting on his stomach as the truck rumbled to life. ‚ÄúI feel like a king being carried to his throne.‚ÄùDavid climbed into the passenger seat, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more like a wrecking ball at this point.‚ÄùEli leaned back against the truck bed, his massive belly securely strapped down‚Äîor so it seemed. The truck rumbled along the winding mountain road, its engine groaning slightly under the weight. The moonlight cast long shadows across the landscape as the truck climbed steadily uphill.Inside the cab, David sat with the driver, glancing nervously at the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure those straps will hold?‚ÄùThe driver grinned confidently. ‚ÄúRelax. This truck‚Äôs hauled construction equipment. He‚Äôs heavy, but he‚Äôs not that heavy.‚ÄùIn the back, Eli shifted uncomfortably as the truck took a sharp turn. His enormous belly swayed heavily to one side, pulling against the straps with a loud creak. His brow furrowed as he felt the tension increase.The straps groaned ominously with each movement, and Eli leaned forward slightly, shouting toward the cab. ‚ÄúHey! I think these things are about to‚Äî‚ÄùBut the wind and the rumble of the truck drowned out his voice.As the truck climbed a steep incline, the sharp turn combined with the incline caused Eli‚Äôs massive belly to sway violently. The straps stretched dangerously, the metal buckles groaning louder with each passing second.‚ÄúGuys! This isn‚Äôt going to‚Äî‚ÄùSNAP!The straps gave way with a deafening crack, and Eli‚Äôs enormous form shifted suddenly. Gravity took over, and he rolled off the truck bed with a heavy thud.‚ÄúDavid!‚Äù Eli shouted as he tumbled, his massive belly leading the way.David whipped his head around, his face going pale. ‚ÄúOh no. Not again.‚ÄùThe sound of snapping branches and rustling bushes filled the air as Eli bounced and rolled down the hill like an enormous ball, his stomach wobbling violently with each impact.The driver hit the brakes, the truck screeching to a halt. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs rolling!‚ÄùDavid groaned, unbuckling his seatbelt. ‚ÄúNo kidding! Turn this thing around!‚ÄùEli‚Äôs chaotic descent ended with a loud splash as he landed in a small, tranquil pond at the base of the hill. Water erupted in waves, rippling violently outward as his massive form disappeared beneath the surface.David and the driver sprinted down the hill, panting as they reached the water‚Äôs edge. The pond was still now, the surface eerily calm, with no sign of Eli.David‚Äôs eyes darted across the water, his chest tightening. ‚ÄúYou think he‚Äî‚ÄùThe driver hesitated, his hands on his hips. ‚ÄúThat pond‚Äôs deep. If he can‚Äôt swim‚Ä¶‚ÄùBefore he could finish, the water‚Äôs surface began to ripple again. A faint, deep gulping sound echoed from below, followed by a powerful whirlpool forming at the center of the pond.David stepped back, his eyes widening. ‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs not‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe driver‚Äôs jaw dropped as the vortex grew stronger, pulling leaves and debris into its swirling depths. The water level began to drop rapidly, exposing the muddy edges of the pond.From beneath the surface, a massive shape began to rise‚Äîa dome-like form pushing up through the remaining water.

Eli grabbed a stack of waffle cones, crunching through them like crackers before shoveling handfuls of strawberries, bananas, and cherries into his mouth. The colorful sprinkles were dumped directly into his mouth from their containers, disappearing with thick gulps. ‚ÄúFaster,‚Äù Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The employee nodded frantically, returning with dispensers of syrups and bottles of whipped cream. Eli grabbed a syrup dispenser, tilting it back and gulping down the thick chocolate sauce like it was water. He emptied two bottles of whipped cream directly into his mouth, the sputtering canisters falling to the floor when they ran dry. David chuckled, crossing his arms as Eli worked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a walking black hole.‚Äù Eli smirked between bites, his hands now working the milkshake dispensers.

His shirt had ridden up completely, leaving his belly fully exposed as it pressed into the counter with enough force to nudge it backward. The employee, pale and shaking, stepped forward cautiously. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ w-who‚Äôs going to pay for all this?‚Äù Eli smirked, wiping a streak of chocolate syrup from his lips. ‚ÄúConsider it your lucky day,‚Äù he said, patting his swollen stomach. ‚ÄúI left you the stand.‚Äù David burst out laughing, grabbing Eli‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúAlright, come on.

Coming right up!‚ÄùThe first wave arrived quickly: boxes of uncooked hot dogs, plastic trays of buns, and gallon-sized tubs of condiments. Eli didn‚Äôt hesitate. He grabbed an entire box of hot dogs, tearing it open and pouring the contents into his mouth. The raw sausages tumbled down his throat in thick gulps, his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing with each swallow. David leaned against the car, smirking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve really got a flair for terrifying small business owners.‚Äù Eli ignored him, already reaching for the next tray. He grabbed stacks of buns, shoving them into his mouth two or three at a time. Crumbs scattered across the counter as he chewed loudly, barely pausing to breathe. ‚ÄúFaster,‚Äù Eli barked, his voice muffled by another mouthful. The vendor scrambled to keep up, dragging out trays of toppings‚Äîjars of relish, ketchup, mustard, and sauerkraut. Eli grabbed them all, twisting off lids and drinking the contents directly. The thick condiments dripped down his chin as he gulped, the empty containers clattering to the ground. His stomach began to swell, rounding out visibly beneath his shirt. The fabric stretched tighter with each bite, riding up to reveal the growing curve. The vendor‚Äôs hands trembled as he brought out the last of the supplies‚Äîbulk boxes of hot dogs and a plastic bin of raw onions. Eli tore into the boxes, dumping the sausages into his mouth like candy. The bin of onions followed, its contents disappearing rapidly as Eli chewed through them without hesitation. Finally, there was nothing left. Eli leaned back slightly, his hands resting on the massive dome of his stomach, which now pressed heavily against the counter. ‚ÄúT-That‚Äôs everything,‚Äù the vendor stammered, wiping sweat from his brow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve eaten it all.‚Äù Eli smirked, licking a streak of mustard from his lips. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said, his voice calm but firm.

He leaned forward, his grin turning predatory. ‚ÄúBe glad I left you the stand,‚Äù Eli said, his voice low. David burst out laughing, walking over to grab Eli‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúAlright, big guy.

The remaining puddle disappeared rapidly as Eli‚Äôs body swelled even further, his skin stretching so tight it glistened under the moonlight. Suddenly, a sharp CREEEEAAAKKK echoed from Eli‚Äôs belly, followed by a deep, ominous WHUMP! His body jolted violently, and he froze mid-gulp, his hands instinctively gripping his sides. David‚Äôs eyes widened in alarm. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù The driver squinted, his tone cautious. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sound good.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs grin faltered for the first time. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I think‚Äî‚Äù Before he could finish, his stomach emitted an ear-splitting BLORRRPPP! that reverberated through the clearing.

The explosion was deafening. Water, mud, and debris erupted into the air as a massive shockwave rolled through the clearing. David and the driver were thrown off their feet, landing hard on the muddy ground as the force rattled the nearby trees. When the chaos subsided, an eerie silence fell over the pond. The once-massive dome of Eli‚Äôs belly was gone. The pond was completely empty, its muddy bottom exposed, but there was no sign of Eli‚Äîno body, no sound, nothing. David pushed himself up on his elbows, his face pale and stunned. ‚ÄúEli?‚Äù he called out, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúEli!‚Äù The driver sat up slowly, wiping mud from his face.

The massive dome of his belly began to shrink, slowly at first, then faster as the water inside seemed to evaporate from within. Steam rose faintly from his body as the tight surface softened and collapsed inward, the once-massive curve flattening rapidly. David and the driver watched in stunned silence as Eli‚Äôs body returned to its normal lean form.

Next to him, Eli was practically buzzing with excitement, his hands fidgeting on his lap. His shirt sat flat against his stomach, a rare sight that David couldn‚Äôt help but notice with a faint smile. ‚ÄúAll-you-can-eat buffet,‚Äù Eli said, almost reverently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù David nodded, keeping his eyes on the road but secretly thrilled at what might unfold. He wasn‚Äôt about to admit it, but there was something mesmerizing about watching Eli‚Äôs seemingly endless appetite take over. Deep down, he wondered just how far Eli could go this time. The parking lot of the buffet was nearly full, the neon sign above the entrance flashing a welcome. As they stepped inside, the aromas hit them like a tidal wave: roasted meats, buttery bread, and sweet desserts all mingling in the air. Eli inhaled deeply, closing his eyes for a moment like he was savoring the smell before the feast even began. ‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù a cheerful waiter greeted them. ‚ÄúTable for two?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, please,‚Äù David replied, his tone calm as always. Eli, meanwhile, barely glanced at the waiter, his attention locked onto the long buffet tables overflowing with food. They were seated in a booth near the middle of the dining room, offering a perfect view of the buffet. The moment they sat down, Eli leaned forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go take a look,‚Äù he said quickly, already sliding out of the booth. David chuckled softly as he watched Eli head straight for the buffet. The man started slow, loading his first plate with roasted chicken, a scoop of mashed potatoes, and a small portion of green beans. It was almost modest. Eli returned to the table, sat down, and ate methodically, savoring each bite. He didn‚Äôt say much, and David didn‚Äôt interrupt, sipping his coffee and waiting. But it wasn‚Äôt long before Eli‚Äôs pace quickened. He wiped his mouth, stood up, and this time grabbed a tray. David leaned back in the booth, his lips curling into a slight smile as Eli began stacking plates onto the tray. First one, then another, then a third. Each plate was piled high: sizzling ribs, creamy pasta, fried shrimp, and golden fries. He even threw in a plate of desserts for good measure. By the time Eli returned to the table, the tray was nearly bending under the weight. He slid into the booth with a look of pure determination, as if this was a challenge he‚Äôd been training for. David folded his arms and watched, his amusement growing as Eli attacked the food with increasing enthusiasm. Plate after plate disappeared. Eli‚Äôs pace grew relentless, and though his eating wasn‚Äôt particularly messy, the sheer volume of food was enough to draw attention from a few nearby diners. The buffet staff, however, remained blissfully unaware of the storm brewing at Eli‚Äôs booth. Finally, as the last bite of dessert vanished, Eli let out a contented sigh. He leaned back in the booth, his stomach visibly swollen beneath his shirt. With a satisfied grin, he pulled up the hem of his shirt, revealing his now-rounded belly. He gave it a couple of hearty pats, the sound of his hand meeting his stretched skin echoing faintly across the booth. ‚ÄúNow that,‚Äù Eli said, ‚Äúis what I call breakfast.‚Äù David couldn‚Äôt hide his grin as he reached for his coffee. The calm moment lingered for just a second longer before the possibilities ahead began to take shape.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli goes wild (non-vore)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli goes wild (vore)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Buffet_non_vore"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Buffet.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Buffet_vore"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Buffet_non_vore":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^After patting his swollen belly with satisfaction, he leaned forward and pushed himself up from the booth. David casually sipped his coffee, watching with quiet amusement as Eli made his way back to the buffet. This time, Eli wasn‚Äôt holding back. He grabbed a tray and began stacking it with plates, one after another. Roasted ribs, fried chicken, piles of pasta, crispy fries, buttered rolls‚Äîevery dish he passed found its way onto a plate. Soon, the tray groaned under the weight of five, six, seven overflowing plates, sauces dripping down the sides, meats stacked so high they threatened to topple over. Eli wobbled slightly under the load but grinned triumphantly as he shuffled back to their booth. David barely glanced up. He casually picked at a small plate of fruit, plucking a single grape and popping it into his mouth. ‚ÄúPacing yourself, I see,‚Äù he remarked dryly. Eli didn‚Äôt answer. He slammed the tray down, grabbed a spoon in one hand and a chunk of bread in the other, and dove in. His eating was relentless. He scooped up pasta by the fistful, shoveled mashed potatoes into his mouth with the spoon, and tore into roasted meat with his bare hands. Gravy and sauce smeared the corners of his mouth, but Eli didn‚Äôt care. His eyes were laser-focused on the food. David leaned back comfortably, observing the spectacle. His smirk widened as he noticed nearby diners starting to stare. Murmurs rippled through the dining hall. A family at a nearby table exchanged uneasy glances. A man paused mid-bite, blinking in disbelief. At the buffet counter, two employees watched Eli with growing concern. ‚ÄúIs he‚Ä¶ is he allowed to take that much?‚Äù one whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all-you-can-eat,‚Äù the other muttered, though uncertainty tinged his voice. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I mean, all?‚Äù Back at the booth, Eli finished another plate and shoved it aside with a loud clang. He barely paused to breathe before moving on to the next, his swollen stomach now pressing tightly against his shirt. The fabric strained, the buttons holding on for dear life. David casually leaned forward. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drawing a bit of a crowd.‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúThey should‚Äôve come earlier if they wanted some,‚Äù he mumbled through a mouthful of fries. Another trip to the buffet. This time, Eli grabbed two trays, stacking plates so high they nearly blocked his vision. Grilled sausages, skewered meats, cheesy casseroles, more fried chicken, entire cakes sliced into quarters‚Äîall heaped in a chaotic mountain of food. The stares grew more intense. The staff huddled near the counter, whispering nervously but still hesitant to intervene. Eli plopped back into the booth with a grunt, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His belly had ballooned outward, round and tight, visibly sagging over the waistband of his pants. Every breath came with a slight wheeze. David raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúStarting to slow down?‚Äù Eli shook his head defiantly, though his movements had noticeably slowed. He rubbed his belly absentmindedly, then grimaced as he leaned forward to grab another plate. But as he stood to return to the buffet again, he paused. His legs felt heavier. His swollen stomach swayed, throwing off his balance. He winced slightly as he shifted his weight. David noticed immediately. ‚ÄúGetting a little hard to move, huh?‚Äù Eli grunted, leaning back against the booth, one hand bracing his overstuffed gut. He patted it absently, contemplating his next move. ‚ÄúI could stay here‚Ä¶ and you could bring me plates,‚Äù Eli muttered, eyeing David.

Go nuts.‚ÄùEli didn‚Äôt need to be told twice.He grabbed a tray and made his way to the buffet, moving with eager determination. He started off relatively normal‚Äîloading up a few plates with generous portions of fried chicken, pasta, and mashed potatoes.But it didn‚Äôt stop there.Eli returned to the buffet over and over, each time stacking more plates onto his tray.Two plates. Four plates. Six plates.Soon, he was balancing multiple trays stacked high with food. Piles of ribs, greasy burgers, fried rice, lasagna, and entire roasted chickens threatened to topple over with every step.Back at the booth, David watched with mild amusement.Eli slammed the trays onto the table and immediately dug in.He devoured everything in sight.Forks and knives became unnecessary. Eli shoveled food into his mouth with both hands, slurping down pasta, tearing into ribs, and gulping down meats whole.His eating was rapid and relentless‚Äîgulp, chew, swallow, repeat.David picked at a small plate of salad, watching with a raised eyebrow.‚ÄúYou know, people are starting to stare,‚Äù David commented casually.And they were.Nearby diners had paused mid-bite, whispering and pointing in disbelief.A family at the next table watched with wide eyes as Eli shoved entire chicken legs into his mouth, crunching through bone without slowing down.Across the room, a waiter leaned in to whisper to another staff member.‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ is that allowed?‚Äù the waiter asked, glancing nervously at Eli‚Äôs growing pile of empty plates.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all-you-can-eat,‚Äù the other muttered, though he didn‚Äôt sound convinced.Eli paid no attention.His belly began to swell, pressing tightly against his shirt.At first, it was subtle.But with each trip to the buffet, each tray of food, his stomach grew larger.It pressed against the edge of the table, stretching his shirt taut.GRRRROOOAN.His gut let out a deep, ominous growl as it expanded outward, rounding and sagging over his waistband.Eli grunted, shifting in his seat to make room.But he wasn‚Äôt slowing down.Back to the buffet. More trays. More plates.His swollen belly wobbled as he walked, the strain becoming more noticeable.David chuckled.‚ÄúStarting to slow down there, champ?‚ÄùEli shot him a glare but didn‚Äôt answer, too focused on cramming more food into his mouth.By now, the entire dining area had noticed.Murmurs rippled through the room.Staff exchanged uneasy glances.One waiter hesitantly approached the manager.‚ÄúShould‚Ä¶ should we say something?‚ÄùThe manager watched Eli with a tense jaw.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wait.

He gave his stomach a few firm pats, then turned his gaze to David. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Eli grunted, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúYour turn. Start bringing me food.‚Äù David raised an eyebrow, but there was a glint of amusement in his eyes. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù Eli‚Äôs only response was to open his mouth wide and point inside, as if daring David to question him. David sighed dramatically but stood up, muttering under his breath, ‚ÄúFine, but you owe me for this.‚Äù He made his way to the buffet, grabbing a tray and piling it high with every dish within reach. Mountains of fried chicken, greasy slabs of ribs, overloaded pasta dishes, and thick wedges of cake. By the time David returned, the tray was bending under the weight. Eli didn‚Äôt even glance at what was on the plates. He grabbed the nearest dish, tipped it over his open mouth, and let the food cascade in. Entire portions of pasta and meats vanished down his throat with wet, sloppy gulps. Sauces dripped down his chin, but Eli didn‚Äôt care. His only pause was to wave impatiently at David. ‚ÄúFaster,‚Äù Eli grunted between mouthfuls. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slowing me down.‚Äù David rolled his eyes but turned back to the buffet. Trip after trip, David kept hauling trays stacked high with food. Each time, Eli barely acknowledged him, simply grabbing plate after plate and dumping them straight into his maw. Occasionally, he stuffed entire drumsticks and ribs into his mouth, gnawing them down to the bone in seconds. His belly, already massive, stretched even further, groaning under the strain of the endless feast. The atmosphere in the buffet began to shift. Customers started whispering, glancing over at the increasingly chaotic scene. A child tugged on her mother‚Äôs sleeve, pointing at Eli with wide eyes. The mother quickly turned her away. At the buffet counter, staff scrambled to refill the rapidly emptying trays, but they were falling behind. Hot trays that once gleamed with fresh food were now barren, scraps clinging to their surfaces. A manager leaned over to a group of waiters, speaking in hushed tones. ‚ÄúSomeone needs to talk to him,‚Äù the manager hissed, eyeing Eli nervously. The waiters exchanged panicked glances. No one volunteered. Meanwhile, David dragged yet another overloaded tray back to the booth, sweat beading on his forehead. His shirt clung to his back, and his steps had slowed noticeably. ‚ÄúEli, this is, what, the twentieth tray?‚Äù David panted, setting it down with a thud. ‚ÄúCan I sit for a second?‚Äù Eli ignored him. He was too focused on pouring an entire plate of cheesy pasta into his mouth, swallowing without even chewing. Then he paused, noticing something. Across from their booth, in the next section, a young man sat alone, his eyes locked on Eli. His face was flushed, his breathing slightly quickened. He didn‚Äôt blink as he watched Eli‚Äôs gluttonous display, fixated on the way Eli‚Äôs belly swelled larger with every bite. Eli met the man‚Äôs gaze. A slow, knowing grin crept across Eli‚Äôs face. He shifted in his seat, spreading his legs to give his bloated belly more room, and gave it a heavy, exaggerated slap. THWUMP. The man flinched, swallowing hard. Eli chuckled and gave him a playful wink. Then, with deliberate slowness, he grabbed a plate of greasy ribs and messily devoured them, licking his fingers in a way that felt intentionally provocative. The young man‚Äôs eyes widened, his face going even redder, but he couldn‚Äôt look away. David returned with another tray, slamming it down. He was out of breath, drenched in sweat, and glaring at Eli. ‚ÄúSeriously‚Ä¶ I need‚Ä¶ to sit.‚Äù Eli, still smirking, leaned back and stretched his arms, causing his belly to bulge even more. David wiped his forehead and leaned against the booth, catching his breath. The tension in the room thickened. The buffet staff huddled together, whispering urgently, casting anxious glances toward Eli.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Waiter tries to stop Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The customer offers help",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.davidWipedTheSwe"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliLeanedHeavily.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.eliLeanedBackInT5"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliShiftedInTheB":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli shifted in the booth, his belly groaning with pressure, but his hunger still burned hot. He planted his hands on the table and pushed himself up with a strained grunt. David watched him with a smirk, leaning back comfortably. ‚ÄúOh oh‚Ä¶‚Äù David murmured to himself, watching Eli lumber toward the buffet. Eli‚Äôs massive gut swayed with each heavy step, brushing against tables and chairs, knocking them slightly out of place. Diners fell silent, staring in stunned disbelief as Eli approached the buffet like a predator eyeing prey. Without hesitation, Eli grabbed a large serving ladle from the nearest tray and began scooping heaps of steaming food directly into his mouth. Mashed potatoes, pasta, casseroles‚ÄîSPLURK, GLOMP, GULP‚Äîeach serving vanished almost instantly. But Eli wasn‚Äôt slowing down. His motions grew faster, more aggressive. The ladle moved in a blur, overfilled with food, until‚ÄîGLNK!‚Äîhe accidentally bit down and swallowed it whole. Eli paused briefly, feeling the ladle slide down his throat. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Hmph.‚Äù Shrugging, he plunged both hands into the food, grabbing fistfuls of steaming dishes. He crammed everything into his mouth‚Äîgreasy fried chicken, ribs, pasta, thick slabs of lasagna. Whole chicken legs and breaded cutlets disappeared in a single bite, bones and all, crunching loudly as they slid down his gullet. When he came across trays of saucy or liquid dishes, Eli simply grabbed the entire metal container, raised it over his head, and tilted it forward. Hot gravy and stews splashed into his mouth, streams of sauce dripping down his chin. The metallic clatter of empty trays echoed through the hall as Eli methodically cleared one after another. His approach was mechanical‚Äîclean a tray, toss it aside, move to the next. His stomach bulged, swelling with each bite. The tight skin creaked and groaned, inflating outward, forcing Eli to adjust his stance. Eventually, his belly grew so massive that it dragged along the ground, forcing him to stand sideways and awkwardly shuffle forward, dragging his overfilled gut behind him. The restaurant was in chaos. Patrons stared in horror and disbelief. Some scrambled to gather their belongings and leave, while others just sat frozen, unsure of what they were witnessing. Behind the buffet counter, the staff huddled in panic. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eating everything!‚Äù a waiter hissed, peeking over the counter. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just stand here!‚Äù another snapped. The manager wiped sweat from his forehead, eyes locked on Eli as he devoured another entire tray of fried rice. ‚ÄúShould we call security?‚Äù one staff member whispered. The manager hesitated. His eyes darted between the destruction and the few remaining customers. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ maybe we can handle this ourselves.‚Äù Another waiter paled. ‚ÄúOurselves?! Look at him! He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a monster!‚Äù Eli continued his rampage, oblivious to the frightened staff. He tore through another set of trays, sauce dripping from his chin, his enormous belly now dragging across the floor with a wet, sloshing sound. The manager gritted his teeth, weighing his options.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Manager calls security",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.6.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Staff decides to intervene",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theManagerWipedS"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair.eliShiftedInTheB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.6.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theManagerClench"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT4":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^Eli leaned back in the booth, his hands resting on his already bloated stomach.

Just‚Ä¶ eat your food.‚ÄùBut her eyes remained on Eli, concern creeping into her expression.At another table, a group of coworkers sat in awkward silence, their half-finished plates forgotten.One of them, a man in his 40s, leaned closer to the group.‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù one of his colleagues asked, nervously glancing toward Eli.The man wiped his mouth with a napkin.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.

Let‚Äôs get out of here.‚ÄùThe group hesitated, exchanging uneasy looks before silently agreeing. Chairs scraped against the floor as they quickly left, casting one last glance at Eli.Eli, of course, paid them no mind.David returned, arms full of stacked plates, and dropped them heavily onto the table.‚ÄúThere.

He immediately started dumping entire plates of food into his mouth, barely bothering to chew.GULP.Gone.GULP.Another one vanished.David leaned against the booth, watching in disbelief.‚ÄúYou know, you could at least pretend to have manners.‚ÄùEli snorted.‚ÄúManners are for people who aren‚Äôt starving to death!‚ÄùDavid sighed and turned back toward the buffet, muttering under his breath.Around them, more customers began shifting uncomfortably in their seats.A couple seated by the window leaned in close.‚ÄúLook at him.

You‚Äôre doing great,‚Äù Eli grinned, opening his mouth wide.David sighed and leaned against the wall, barely able to stand. Behind the buffet, the staff huddled together, watching Eli with wide eyes.A young waiter clutched his serving tray tightly.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eating everything! We can‚Äôt keep up!‚ÄùAnother server leaned in, panicked.‚ÄúWhat are we supposed to do?

At a booth nearby, a young man sat alone, completely mesmerized by Eli.His eyes followed every movement‚Äîevery gulp, every stretch of Eli‚Äôs swollen belly.His face was flushed, breathing uneven.Eli caught his stare.A slow, knowing grin spread across Eli‚Äôs face.Maintaining eye contact, Eli grabbed a massive piece of meat and slowly bit into it, deliberately letting grease and juices drip down his chin.The young man‚Äôs breath caught in his throat, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.Eli chuckled to himself.David, exhausted, finally slumped into the booth, sweat dripping down his face.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ carry another tray,‚Äù David panted.Eli barely acknowledged him, licking his fingers.‚ÄúFine.

With a strained grunt, he heaved himself up from the booth, his stomach wobbling heavily with the effort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make this easier for everyone,‚Äù he muttered, already lumbering toward the buffet.Eli approached the buffet with slow, deliberate steps. Without hesitation, he grabbed the largest serving ladle he could find. He dunked it deep into a tray of macaroni and cheese and flung the heaping portion into his mouth. GULP. Gone. Another scoop. GULP. Another. He moved systematically, tray by tray, wiping out the entire buffet line. Mashed potatoes, fried chicken, pasta, gravy‚Äînothing was safe. He dug into a tray of meatballs, loading scoop after scoop into his gaping maw. The loud CLANG of the ladle scraping the bottom of empty trays echoed through the now-quiet restaurant. But in his frenzy, he didn‚Äôt realize he had scooped too deeply‚ÄîCLUNK. The entire ladle slipped into his mouth. GULP. Gone. Eli paused, blinking slowly. He rubbed his chest thoughtfully. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh.‚Äù He briefly hesitated, then lazily shrugged and plunged his bare hands into the next tray, scooping out sticky piles of cheesy pasta and shoving it into his mouth. When he reached soups and gravies, he grabbed the entire metal trays, tilted them back, and poured the hot liquids directly into his throat. SLUUUURP. The empty trays clattered to the floor with loud metallic clangs.As Eli devoured more and more, his belly began to swell rapidly. It pushed further out, rounding and groaning as it expanded. The seams of his shirt stretched tight, buttons creaking. His gut sagged forward, drooping lower with each heaving breath. Soon, it grew so large that it began to drag along the floor behind him, leaving a greasy trail of crumbs and sauce. THUD. He knocked over a buffet table with his stomach but didn‚Äôt stop. Guests stared in horror. A mother clutched her child closer. ‚ÄúOh my God‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered. A family near the back huddled together. ‚ÄúMom, is that man okay?‚Äù a little boy whispered. The mother grabbed his hand tightly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving. Now.‚Äù Chairs scraped the floor as people hurried toward the exits.Behind the buffet, the staff had gone pale, huddled together.

He turned slowly toward the buffet counter, where the staff cowered. His belly was now so massive it sloshed and dragged heavily behind him, filling most of the aisle. Step by step, he began shuffling forward, eyes locked on the trembling employees. The floor creaked with each heavy step. David watched from a distance, frozen. ‚ÄúOh, no‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered.

He slumped against the edge of the booth, panting heavily. But Eli wasn‚Äôt satisfied. Not even close. ‚ÄúDavid!‚Äù Eli barked, pounding a meaty fist on the table. The plates rattled from the force. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starving! Quit slacking and get me more!‚Äù David groaned, dragging himself to his feet. ‚ÄúUnbelievable‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered under his breath, stumbling back toward the buffet. At the counter, the staff huddled together, voices low but urgent. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. Someone has to say something,‚Äù the manager hissed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs scaring the customers!‚Äù another waiter whispered, glancing nervously at Eli‚Äôs enormous, exposed belly bulging over the table. After a tense silence, one unfortunate waiter was pushed forward. ‚ÄúGo. Just... ask him to stop.‚Äù The waiter swallowed hard and slowly approached Eli‚Äôs booth, wringing his hands. ‚ÄúUm... s-sir?‚Äù he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. Eli didn‚Äôt even look up, still shoveling food into his mouth. ‚ÄúSir, we... w-we must kindly ask you to stop eating. You‚Äôve consumed more than enough, and, well... your exposed stomach is making some guests... uncomfortable.‚Äù The words hung in the air like a death sentence. Eli slowly lowered his latest plate, licking sauce from his fingers. His eyes flicked lazily toward the trembling waiter. Then, without warning, Eli leaned forward, casting a heavy shadow over the man. He opened his mouth wide‚Äîunnaturally wide. His jaws stretched impossibly far, revealing a cavernous, dark maw that seemed to pull the very air around it. The waiter‚Äôs eyes bulged in pure terror. ‚ÄúYou see this?‚Äù Eli growled, voice low and rumbling. ‚ÄúIf you and the rest of your little friends don‚Äôt start bringing me food, you‚Äôre all going in next.‚Äù The waiter stumbled back, nearly tripping over his own feet. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôll tell them!‚Äù he squeaked and fled toward the kitchen. Moments later, the staff hesitantly began approaching Eli‚Äôs booth, balancing trays stacked high with food. One by one, they nervously placed them down. But Eli‚Äôs belly had grown so massive, it had already crushed part of the table and the booth itself. The wood splintered under the pressure, his gut spilling outward, dominating the space. The staff had no choice but to start placing trays directly on top of Eli‚Äôs ballooned stomach. The plates wobbled precariously on the taut, round surface. Eli grinned wickedly and tipped another plate into his mouth. David, now free from his food-hauling duties, casually slid back into the booth‚Äîwhat was left of it, anyway. He leaned back comfortably, watching the chaos unfold with clear amusement. ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù David smirked, ‚ÄúThis is much more efficient.‚Äù Across the dining room, guests began to rise from their tables, whispering anxiously and making their way to the exit. Chairs scraped loudly against the floor as people left in a steady stream. No one wanted to be around for what might come next. Except for one. The young man from the neighboring booth had moved closer, unable to resist. His face was flushed, his breathing shallow. Almost hypnotically, he reached out a trembling hand and gently pressed it against Eli‚Äôs swollen, hot belly. He rubbed in slow, tentative circles, his eyes locked in fascination. Eli noticed. He chuckled, letting out a deep, guttural belch that rattled the plates on his stomach. The young man flinched but didn‚Äôt pull away. Tray after tray kept arriving, the buffet staff now moving mechanically, pale and terrified. Eli‚Äôs belly swelled larger and larger, creaking ominously as it pressed outward, warping the remains of the booth. Plates and trays teetered on his stomach, barely balanced. Then, silence. No more trays came. One of the waiters, ghostly pale, nervously approached the towering mass of Eli and the wreckage around him. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ s-sir?‚Äù the waiter quivered. ‚ÄúW-we‚Ä¶ w-we‚Äôre out of food‚Ä¶‚Äù The dining hall was dead silent. David slowly turned to look at Eli, raising an eyebrow. The young man‚Äôs hand froze mid-rub, eyes darting nervously toward Eli.

Plates and trays were scattered around him, and David slumped against the wall, completely exhausted, wiping sweat from his face. But Eli wasn‚Äôt slowing down. ‚ÄúDavid! More!‚Äù Eli barked, his deep voice rattling the remaining glasses on the tables. David groaned, barely able to stand. ‚ÄúEli, I swear, if I have to carry one more tray‚Äî‚Äù Before David could finish, a hesitant voice interrupted. ‚ÄúU-um‚Ä¶ I-I can help.‚Äù Both Eli and David turned. Standing awkwardly beside the booth was the young man from the nearby table‚Äîthe one who had been watching Eli with wide, fascinated eyes. His face was flushed deep red, his hands fidgeting nervously at his sides. ‚ÄúI-I mean‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs okay. I‚Ä¶ I could help bring more food,‚Äù the man stammered, stealing glances at Eli‚Äôs massive, glistening belly. David blinked in surprise, but then shrugged, too exhausted to care. ‚ÄúSure. Knock yourself out,‚Äù David muttered, sinking back into the booth. The man‚Äôs eyes lit up. He spun on his heel and practically ran to the buffet, grabbing a tray and piling it high with anything he could find. He returned in record time, breathless, the tray overflowing. With trembling hands, he leaned forward and carefully tilted a plate of greasy pasta into Eli‚Äôs wide-open mouth. GULP. It vanished instantly. The man shivered, eyes locked on Eli‚Äôs throat as it bulged with the massive swallow. Without thinking, he reached out and gently stroked Eli‚Äôs taut, swollen belly. His fingers trailed across the stretched skin, lingering for a second too long. Eli raised an eyebrow and grinned. ‚ÄúOh, you like that, huh?‚Äù Eli teased, patting his own belly, causing it to jiggle under the man‚Äôs hand. The young man‚Äôs face burned even redder, but he couldn‚Äôt stop himself. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôll get more!‚Äù he stammered and bolted back to the buffet. David smirked. ‚ÄúWell, looks like you‚Äôve got yourself a fan club.‚Äù Eli chuckled deeply, his belly wobbling. The young man returned again and again, each time with more trays of food. He fed Eli eagerly, dumping plates of food directly into his mouth, and each time, he let his hand glide over Eli‚Äôs ballooning gut, marveling at how it stretched larger and larger. Eli leaned into it, opening his mouth wide and grinning between bites. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing a better job than David,‚Äù Eli teased, licking sauce off his lips. ‚ÄúKeep it coming, sweetheart.‚Äù The man nearly dropped the tray, his hands shaking, but he quickly recovered, running back for more.The chaos was noticed by the staff. A waiter, pale and trembling, finally mustered the courage to approach Eli‚Äôs booth. ‚ÄúE-excuse me, sir,‚Äù the waiter stammered, his voice barely holding steady. ‚ÄúY-you‚Äôve eaten more than enough. I-I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to‚Ä¶ stop.‚Äù Eli slowly turned to him, his grin fading into something darker. Without a word, he shot out a thick hand and grabbed the waiter by the front of his shirt, yanking him forward effortlessly. The waiter let out a startled yelp. Eli leaned in, his mouth stretching open impossibly wide, revealing rows of teeth and a dark, cavernous throat. With slow, deliberate force, Eli pushed the waiter‚Äôs head forward, just barely inside his massive mouth. Hot breath washed over the terrified man. The waiter let out a strangled scream, his limbs flailing. After a tense second, Eli pulled him back and dropped him to the floor with a dismissive grunt. The waiter scrambled backward on all fours, eyes wide in horror, before leaping to his feet and sprinting away. Eli let out a booming, guttural laugh, his stomach bouncing. David shook his head with a smirk. ‚ÄúSubtle.‚Äù The young man, now emboldened by the scene, eagerly returned with another tray, but his face fell as he approached. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre out of food,‚Äù he mumbled, crestfallen. Eli paused, licking his lips thoughtfully. His belly let out a deep, ominous GRRRRROOOWL. David leaned forward with a sigh. ‚ÄúOh, great. Now what?‚Äù The young man hesitated, then nervously spoke up. ‚ÄúM-maybe‚Ä¶ maybe we could, um‚Ä¶ feed him the furniture?‚Äù he suggested, voice shaking but hopeful. ‚ÄúOr, you know, the decorations?‚Äù David‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù Eli chuckled darkly, his eyes glinting with interest. David groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúOr,‚Äù David said firmly, ‚Äúwe end this now. You‚Äôve caused enough damage.

With shaking hands, he dialed a number. ‚ÄúYeah, security? We need help. Now.‚Äù Minutes later, the front doors slammed open. Two large security guards in crisp uniforms strode into the restaurant. Their arms bulged beneath their sleeves, and their heavy boots thudded across the floor. The taller one adjusted his cap and scanned the room. ‚ÄúThat the guy?‚Äù he grunted, nodding toward Eli, who was busy shoveling food into his mouth. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the manager stammered. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he won‚Äôt stop eating.

He leaned over the buffet counter, pouring an entire tray of mashed potatoes straight into his mouth. The first guard cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù he barked. ‚ÄúYou need to leave. Now.‚Äù Eli ignored him, grabbing a metal tray of fried chicken and chomping into it without hesitation. The second guard narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúHey! I said you need to leave!‚Äù Still nothing. Growing irritated, the second guard stepped forward and tapped Eli on the shoulder. Eli froze. The buffet fell silent. Slowly, Eli set down the tray and turned his massive form to face them. His belly groaned as it shifted, sagging heavily toward the floor. Both guards tried to maintain their tough expressions, but sweat beaded on their foreheads, dripping from beneath their caps. Eli loomed over them, his massive gut rising and falling with each heavy breath. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Eli growled, voice low and rumbling. The taller guard straightened up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done here. You need to leave the premises.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù he smirked. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you make me?‚Äù The guards hesitated, exchanging a quick, nervous glance. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù They both lunged forward, each grabbing one of Eli‚Äôs thick arms. They pulled. Nothing happened. Eli didn‚Äôt budge an inch. The guards strained, gritting their teeth, muscles bulging as they tried to drag him. Eli grinned. ‚ÄúMaybe you should lift this first,‚Äù he chuckled, slapping his gigantic belly with a loud THWUMP. The guards looked at each other, then down at the enormous gut spilling across the floor. Reluctantly, they crouched down and shoved their arms under the massive dome of flesh. With visible strain, they heaved upward. GRRRRRNNNK! The bloated mass lifted just a few inches off the ground. Eli inhaled deeply‚Äîhis chest expanding, his belly stretching tighter‚Äî Then he lurched forward. BOOOOOM! His colossal stomach slammed outward, crashing into both guards. THUD! They flew backward like ragdolls, landing hard on their backs. Before they could scramble up, Eli‚Äôs belly came down with a heavy SLAM, pinning them beneath its massive weight. ‚ÄúMMMPH!‚Äù The guards squirmed helplessly, limbs flailing. Eli let out a deep, guttural laugh, his belly jiggling with each breath. ‚ÄúNice try, boys.‚Äù He patted his stomach, causing another wave of flesh to press down on the struggling men. Eli casually turned back to the buffet and resumed eating, grabbing handfuls of food and shoving it into his mouth. The manager and remaining staff peeked nervously from behind the counter, too terrified to intervene.

Eli stood at the buffet, his colossal belly dragging along the floor, stretching impossibly wide as he devoured everything in sight. Tray after tray disappeared into his mouth without pause. The staff huddled in terror behind the counter, their faces pale.  The manager, trembling, fumbled for his phone.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm calling security.‚Äù  His hands shook as he dialed.  ‚ÄúSecurity? We need help at King‚Äôs Buffet‚Äî*right now!*‚Äù  Moments later, the entrance doors slammed open.  Two massive security guards stormed in, their uniforms tight over their bulging muscles.  They stopped dead in their tracks at the sight of Eli.  The taller one leaned over to his partner.  ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ what the hell is that?‚Äù  The manager rushed over, panicked.  ‚Äú*Please!* You have to stop him! He‚Äôs eating *everything!*‚Äù  The first guard cracked his knuckles, masking his hesitation.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this.‚Äù  They strode toward Eli, who was still casually pouring entire trays of food into his mouth, ignoring the commotion.  The first guard cleared his throat.  ‚ÄúSir, step away from the buffet and leave the premises.‚Äù  No response.  Eli grabbed another tray and shoved the entire contents into his mouth.  The second guard stepped closer, his tone sharper.  ‚Äú*HEY!* I said, step away!‚Äù  Still nothing.  The second guard growled, reaching out to tap Eli on the shoulder.  Eli slowly stopped chewing.  The restaurant fell into a suffocating silence.  David, standing at a safe distance, muttered under his breath.  ‚ÄúOh boy‚Ä¶ here we go.‚Äù  Eli carefully set the empty tray down.  Then, with agonizing slowness, he turned his massive body to face them.  His enormous belly *groaned* as it shifted forward, forcing both guards to stumble backward.  Eli stared at them blankly.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶Can I help you?‚Äù he asked flatly.  The guards tried to hold their ground, but sweat was already glistening on their foreheads.  ‚ÄúYou need to leave. *Now,*‚Äù the first guard ordered, though his voice wavered.  Eli squinted.  ‚ÄúWhat was that? Come closer. I can‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù  The second guard scowled.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play dumb!‚Äù  Frustrated, both guards lunged forward and grabbed Eli by the arms.  Eli blinked slowly.  Then, in an instant, he *ripped* his arms free and grabbed both guards.  Before they could scream‚Äî  *GULP.*  He shoved them both into his mouth and swallowed them whole.  The restaurant went dead silent.  Then‚Äî  ‚Äú*HE ATE THEM!*‚Äù  Panic erupted.  Guests screamed and fled toward the exits, knocking over chairs and tables.  The remaining staff bolted for the kitchen, shoving each other aside to escape into the back.  But Eli didn‚Äôt chase them.  He calmly continued eating, emptying the last of the buffet.  David, standing nearby, snorted.  ‚ÄúWell, that worked out great.‚Äù  Eli let out a deep, rumbling *BURRRRP* that shook the remaining walls.  But Eli wasn‚Äôt finished.  He turned his head slowly toward the swinging kitchen doors.  David frowned.  ‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ Eli, don‚Äôt.‚Äù  Eli‚Äôs grin widened.  Without hesitation, he lumbered forward, dragging his massive gut behind him.  He *smashed* through the kitchen doors, the frame splintering under his weight.  The staff screamed in terror as they scrambled to hide behind counters and shelves.  ‚Äú*PLEASE!*‚Äù one of the cooks shrieked.  But Eli didn‚Äôt slow down.  He reached over the counter and grabbed two employees, lifting them effortlessly.  *GULP. GULP.*  Gone.  The remaining staff tried to run, but Eli was too fast.  One by one, they vanished down his throat.  *GULP.*  The manager, hiding in the corner, trembled as Eli‚Äôs shadow loomed over him.  ‚ÄúN-no, please‚Äî‚Äù  *GULP.*  The kitchen fell silent.  Eli wiped his mouth lazily, patting his enormous belly, now swollen beyond belief.  *GRRRROOOAN.*  His gut groaned and sloshed, stretching taut and veiny, filling half the destroyed kitchen.  David cautiously stepped through the wreckage.  ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ now we have a *real* problem.‚Äù  Eli chuckled, giving his massive belly a heavy slap.  David sighed and raised two fingers.  ‚ÄúOption one‚Äîyou activate your metabolism and burn it off.‚Äù  Eli groaned in protest.  ‚ÄúOr option two‚ÄîI call the truck. Again.

The staff exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what to do. David remained slouched in the corner of the wrecked booth, watching with idle curiosity. Eli‚Äôs gaze flicked to the large artificial palm tree standing beside the ruined booth‚Äîa tacky decoration meant to give the buffet a ‚Äútropical‚Äù vibe. Without breaking eye contact with the staff, Eli slowly reached out, wrapped his thick fingers around the plastic trunk, and yanked it free from its base. The staff gasped. Eli casually lifted the artificial tree over his head and, with a sickening gulp, shoved it into his gaping mouth. The plastic leaves crumpled, the thick trunk bent, and the entire tree disappeared down his throat in one impossibly long swallow. A loud, wet GLLL-GGGLLK! echoed through the room. His stomach groaned, swelling even larger, the surface stretching tight and shiny. The room fell deathly silent. Eli let out a deep, satisfied BUUURRP that rattled the empty plates around him. He lazily patted his grotesquely swollen gut, which now loomed over the shattered remains of the table. ‚ÄúStill hungry,‚Äù Eli growled, narrowing his eyes at the stunned staff. ‚ÄúStart feeding me. Everything.‚Äù The staff didn‚Äôt hesitate this time. They scattered in all directions, frantically grabbing chairs, bar stools, trays, and anything not bolted to the floor. One waiter shakily dragged a full beverage dispenser toward Eli, sloshing soda everywhere. Another struggled to carry a cash register, arms trembling. Eli watched them with gleeful anticipation. One by one, the items were dumped into his waiting mouth. CLUNK! A metal chair vanished with a deep gulp. CRUNCH! A stack of trays shattered as they slid down his throat. GLURRKK! An entire countertop display rack of desserts disappeared in seconds. Eli‚Äôs belly surged outward, rumbling and groaning under the impossible weight. Its surface bulged and shifted, sloshing heavily as it spread across the floor. The booth was completely obliterated, replaced by Eli‚Äôs massive, wobbling stomach. David remained seated on a broken fragment of bench, arms crossed. He smirked as he watched the chaos unfold. The last remaining customers had fled in terror, the doors slamming behind them. Only a handful of pale, trembling employees remained, scrambling to keep Eli fed. The young man who had been watching Eli from the other booth was still there, standing closer now, mesmerized. His hand lightly caressed Eli‚Äôs bloated stomach, eyes wide with awe. Soon, there was nothing left to feed him. The restaurant was stripped bare‚Äîno furniture, no counters, not even decorations. Only cracked tiles and Eli‚Äôs enormous, heaving belly remained. The staff stood motionless, drenched in sweat, too afraid to speak.

Eli sat in the middle of the barren room, his belly now an impossibly enormous, swollen dome of flesh. It spread out in every direction, dominating the entire space.

Plates and broken furniture were crushed beneath the sheer weight of his bloated form. But his eyes were still locked on the double doors leading to the kitchen. David noticed the familiar, hungry glint in Eli‚Äôs eyes and groaned. ‚ÄúOh no. Don‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù Eli grinned slowly, licking his lips. ‚ÄúJust a little dessert before we go,‚Äù he rumbled, turning toward the kitchen. David threw up his hands. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. What‚Äôs left to eat, the oven?‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt answer. He shuffled forward, dragging his impossibly bloated belly behind him. His gut sloshed and groaned with each step, spreading out wider than his own arms could reach. As he approached the kitchen doors, it became clear that even the double doors were far too narrow for him. Eli tried squeezing through sideways, but his stomach pressed against the doorframe with a deep, wet squelch. He grunted in frustration. ‚ÄúOh, come on‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli growled and pushed harder, his bulk straining against the frame. Inside the kitchen, chefs stared in silent horror. The doors buckled as Eli leaned in, the metal hinges creaking. His belly mashed into the doorway, pressing inward, causing the walls around the frame to crack and crumble. CRRRRACK! The plaster split, and the frame warped. With a guttural roar, Eli shoved forward with all his strength. BOOOOM! The entire section of the wall gave way, and Eli‚Äôs enormous belly exploded into the kitchen, knocking over racks of utensils, counters, and shelves. Pots and pans crashed to the floor. ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù one of the chefs screamed. The kitchen staff scrambled in all directions, fleeing toward the storage rooms. Eli barely noticed. His attention was on the piles of ingredients and half-prepared dishes. Without hesitation, he began grabbing everything within reach‚Äîraw meat, bags of flour, crates of vegetables‚Äîand stuffing it all into his mouth. He didn‚Äôt chew. He didn‚Äôt care. Whole frozen chickens, sacks of rice, entire wheels of cheese‚Äîthey all vanished into his endless maw. The kitchen was in chaos. Eli grabbed a massive pot of soup and dumped it into his mouth, swallowing the pot as well. His belly surged outward, creaking ominously as it inflated even larger, knocking over shelves and shattering countertops. But it still wasn‚Äôt enough. Eli‚Äôs head slowly turned toward the large metal door of the storage room. A wicked grin stretched across his face. David, watching from the dining hall, shook his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúOh, for the love of‚Ä¶ Eli, really?‚Äù Eli didn‚Äôt answer. He lumbered forward, his gut squelching and slapping against the floor. The storage room door barely held as Eli leaned into it. BOOM! The heavy door dented inward, then burst open. Eli squeezed through with effort, his belly flattening against the walls, shelves groaning under the pressure. Inside, the chefs cowered in the far corner, trembling. Eli didn‚Äôt even notice them. He grabbed full crates and shoved them into his mouth‚Äîsealed boxes of dried mashed potatoes, bulk containers of oil, giant sacks of sugar. Nothing was spared. Cardboard, plastic, glass‚Äîit all vanished with sickening GLOMP sounds. The room shook as his stomach expanded, spreading across the storage floor, pressing against the walls. CRACK. The walls buckled under the pressure. Somewhere beneath him, there were muffled screams and the faint, wet crunching of bones, but Eli ignored it. SLURP. Another crate disappeared. When the shelves were bare, Eli leaned back, letting out a thunderous, bone-rattling BURRRRP that echoed through the shattered storage room. Satisfied, he slowly turned, his enormous belly grinding against the walls, crushing what remained of the shelving. Then‚ÄîBOOM!‚Äîhe forced his way back out, bursting through the weakened wall into the ruined kitchen. In the corner of the storage room, three crushed chefs lay motionless, half-buried beneath the wreckage, their bodies flattened by Eli‚Äôs rampaging bulk. David stood in the middle of the destroyed dining hall, arms crossed. ‚ÄúFeeling better now?‚Äù David muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Eli lumbered forward, his stomach now so massive it dragged behind him, wobbling with every step. ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù Eli grunted, giving his belly a heavy slap. The shockwave made the broken chairs near David wobble. David rubbed his temple in frustration. ‚ÄúOkay, genius, now how exactly are we supposed to get you home?‚Äù Eli‚Äôs bloated form swayed slightly as he pondered the question. David raised two fingers. ‚ÄúOption one: You activate your metabolism and burn this off. Might take a while, but at least you‚Äôll fit through the door.‚Äù Eli grunted. ‚ÄúOption two: I call my buddy with the truck. Again.‚Äù Eli tilted his head, considering.

The cold glow of the building‚Äôs exterior lights bathed the scene in a harsh white glare. The officers opened the back door, and Eli slowly stepped out, his oversized clothes hanging limply from his deflated frame. He looked small, fragile‚Äîeven harmless. David climbed out of the passenger seat of another car, his hands shoved deep into his jacket pockets. He watched nervously as the officers led Eli up the concrete steps. One of the officers threw David a sharp glance. \"You wait here,\" the officer barked, jerking his thumb toward the hard plastic chairs lining the hallway inside. David nodded silently, dropping into one of the chairs. His foot began bouncing anxiously as he watched Eli disappear behind a heavy metal door. The station was cold and sterile. The buzz of fluorescent lights hummed above. David could hear distant phones ringing, quiet murmurs from officers, and the occasional shuffle of papers. Every sound made his nerves tighten. Eli was guided down a long, empty hallway. His footsteps echoed unnervingly off the whitewashed walls. His throat tightened. His stomach, nearly empty now, gave a quiet groan that he prayed no one noticed. They reached a metal door with a small, fogged window. One of the officers yanked it open. \"Sit,\" the older detective ordered, his tone sharp. Eli slipped into the cold metal chair, folding in on himself. The room was small, the air stale. A bare lightbulb swung slightly overhead, casting hard shadows across the table. Across from him sat two detectives. The older one had a stone-cold face, deep lines carved around his mouth. The younger one leaned against the wall, arms crossed, eyes locked on Eli. The older detective spoke first, his voice slow and heavy. \"Start talking.\" Eli blinked, confused. \"About what?\" The detective‚Äôs eyes narrowed. \"Witnesses say you devoured enough food to shut down an entire buffet. Piles of it. And you were growing. Ballooning right there in front of everyone. Now, you‚Äôre sitting here like nothing happened.\" He leaned in, his voice darkening. \"Explain.\" Eli gave a weak chuckle. \"I-I was just hungry?\" The younger detective pushed off the wall, stepping closer. \"Hungry?\" he snapped. \"That‚Äôs the best you‚Äôve got? You expect us to believe that?\" Eli opened his mouth, but nothing came out. The older detective‚Äôs lip curled. \"No one eats that much. And no one shrinks back to normal like flipping a switch. So, how‚Äôd you do it?\" \"I-I guess I digest fast?\" Eli mumbled, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I don‚Äôt know. I just... can‚Äôt stop when I start eating.\" GGRRRROOOOAAAN. The sound ripped through the air, wet and deep. Eli‚Äôs face burned red as his stomach gurgled violently. He wrapped his arms around his middle, squeezing as if he could shut it up. The younger detective laughed dryly. \"Still hungry? After eating half the city?\" Eli gave a nervous smile. \"Guess so...\" The older detective wasn‚Äôt amused. He slammed his hand on the metal table, the noise cracking through the room like a gunshot. Eli flinched hard. \"Enough games! People are scared. Property‚Äôs damaged. You could‚Äôve hurt someone. So how did you do it?\" Eli‚Äôs breathing quickened. His stomach let out another loud, bubbling growl. His eyes darted between them. \"I‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry, okay?! I didn‚Äôt mean to cause any trouble!\" His voice cracked. \"I just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really thirsty. Could I... maybe get some water? From the fountain outside?\" The older detective froze, staring at him with cold eyes. \"Water?\" he repeated slowly. Eli nodded quickly. \"Y-yeah. Just a drink, please.\" The younger detective narrowed his eyes, glancing at his partner. Neither of them moved. The room seemed to shrink, the walls pressing in. David sat frozen in the hallway, staring at the door Eli had been led through, unaware of the storm brewing inside. The silence in the interrogation room thickened.

The hallway was cold and quiet, each step echoing in the stillness. David glanced up from the bench as they passed, his eyes flicking between Eli and the officer trailing him. Eli offered a weak, apologetic smile. They stopped in front of the drinking fountain at the end of the hall. Eli leaned down and pressed the button, letting the cool stream of water trickle into his mouth. He drank. And drank. And drank. The officer leaned against the wall, arms crossed, watching with growing annoyance. \"Alright, that‚Äôs enough. Let‚Äôs go.\" But Eli didn‚Äôt stop. The trickle of water kept flowing into his mouth, and slowly, ever so slowly, his stomach began to push forward, rounding out beneath his oversized shirt. The officer‚Äôs brow furrowed. \"Hey! I said that‚Äôs enough!\" He grabbed Eli‚Äôs shoulder and yanked, but Eli didn‚Äôt budge. His hands clung to the sides of the fountain, fingers gripping the metal with surprising strength. \"What the‚Äî\" The officer pulled harder. \"Let go!\" But Eli‚Äôs belly continued to swell, stretching outward, his shirt riding up to reveal the skin underneath. His stomach groaned as it expanded, round and taut. \"Dammit!\" The officer let go, panic creeping into his voice. He turned on his heel and bolted back toward the interrogation room. \"HEY! I need backup!\" Eli‚Äôs eyes, wide with panic and hunger, darted around. His lips tightened, and without thinking, he lunged forward and bit clean through the thin metal spout of the fountain. The broken pipe hissed, and a powerful jet of water gushed straight into his mouth. The effect was immediate. Eli‚Äôs belly ballooned outward, swelling rapidly. His skin stretched tight, groaning under the pressure as water pumped into him with unstoppable force. Footsteps thundered back down the hallway. The younger officer returned with the older detective at his heels. \"What the hell is going on?!\" the older detective barked. \"There‚Äôs something wrong with him!\" the younger officer shouted, pointing at Eli. Both officers rushed forward, grabbing Eli‚Äôs arms, trying to yank him away, but Eli‚Äôs bloated body barely budged. His stomach now filled most of the hallway, rounding out like an enormous, water-filled balloon. His limbs were almost engulfed by his own swelling torso. \"Pull harder!\" the older detective roared. But no matter how hard they pulled, Eli was stuck. The water roared into him, and his belly expanded even faster, pressing hard against the walls. The hallway creaked ominously. The officer who had been watching David finally bolted toward them. \"What the hell‚Äôs happening?!\" \"Help us get him off!\" the older detective snapped. But it was too late. Eli's stomach surged forward, slamming into the three officers and pinning them against the walls. The fleshy, water-filled mass expanded relentlessly, sealing them in. David‚Äôs eyes widened in horror. The officers‚Äô shouts were muffled by the soft, groaning stretch of Eli‚Äôs belly pressing tighter. David didn‚Äôt hesitate. He sprinted down the hall, dodging the bulging mass that had swallowed the corridor. Behind him, he heard the muffled screams and the wet creaks of Eli‚Äôs belly straining against the walls. Then‚ÄîCRACK. The sound echoed through the station like thunder. David‚Äôs heart pounded as he burst through the station doors and into the cold night air. He stopped in the middle of the empty street, chest heaving, staring back at the entrance. The building groaned behind him. Shouts echoed inside, followed by deep, ominous rumbling.

GGRRRUUUMP! In one horrifying instant, the younger detective vanished into Eli‚Äôs gaping maw, his scream cut short as his body slid down Eli's throat with a sickening squelch. Eli's belly immediately surged outward, swelling with the weight of his swallowed prey. His shirt lifted slightly as his stomach rounded out, wobbling heavily. The older detective stumbled back, reaching for his gun. \"You‚ÄîSTAY BACK!\" But Eli was already moving. GULLOOOOP! The older detective was gone, sucked down in one massive gulp. Eli's belly bulged even larger, jiggling under its own weight. He patted his gut, as the two bodies shifted inside, pressing against the taut surface. Eli exhaled slowly, steadying himself. His belly groaned deeply, sloshing with every slight movement. The room fell into dead silence. Eli glanced down at his now heavily distended stomach, watching it lurch as the detectives squirmed faintly inside. \"...Better.\" Without hesitation, Eli barreled through the door, the metal slamming open with a violent CRASH. The officer standing guard outside spun around. \"What the‚Äî\" GLOORRMP! Eli‚Äôs swollen gut rocked forward as the guard disappeared in one quick swallow. His stomach pushed even further outward, rounding like a massive overfilled balloon, sloshing and groaning. David shot to his feet, eyes wide in disbelief.

Eli raised a trembling finger. \"Go,\" he panted, his belly wobbling with the motion. \"Now.\" David‚Äôs eyes flicked from Eli‚Äôs bloated form to the end of the hall. \"...What are you gonna do?\" he asked, his voice shaking. Eli gave a lopsided grin. His stomach gurgled deeply, a slow, ominous sound. \"I'll... handle the rest.\" David didn‚Äôt wait for another word. He turned and sprinted down the hallway. Behind him, the building erupted into chaos. THUD! \"HE'S LOOSE!\" SCREAMS. GLOOOORP! David weaved through the corridors as the walls trembled with the sounds of destruction‚Äîterrified shouts blending with deep, monstrous gulping noises. CRASH! GURGLE... GULP! David burst through the station doors, lungs burning, and stumbled onto the cold pavement. He turned back toward the building, chest heaving. Through the glass, he could see it‚ÄîEli‚Äôs enormous, heaving belly pressing against the windows. The distorted silhouettes of people still struggling inside bulged faintly beneath the stretched skin. Eli shifted slightly, and the massive dome of his stomach quivered, sloshing heavily.

His flesh stretched from wall to wall, quivering under its own weight. The drywall groaned, fractures spiderwebbing along the ceiling. One officer inched closer, hand shaking. \"Is... is that even human?\" CRRRAAACK. The walls buckled. A deep, sickening groan vibrated through the building as the structure began to give way. Then, in one horrifying moment, the walls snapped. With an explosive crack, Eli's enormous belly burst through the crumbling walls like a tidal wave of flesh. It rolled forward in a massive surge, obliterating desks, walls, and anything in its path. Officers and staff screamed as they were caught in the unstoppable avalanche, bodies crushed beneath the relentless expansion. BOOM! Room after room was devoured, the force of Eli‚Äôs swelling body splintering the station‚Äôs foundation. Filing cabinets crumpled like paper. Doors ripped off their hinges. Sirens inside the building blared, then were snuffed out by the suffocating mass. Outside, David heard it all. The deep, echoing thuds, the splintering walls, the terrified screams. He took a cautious step backward, his eyes locked on the station as it trembled violently. Windows rattled. Cracks split the exterior walls. Then, he heard it‚Äîa low, drawn-out groan, as if the entire building was holding its breath. David‚Äôs instincts screamed at him, and he quickly crossed the street, putting more distance between himself and the station. His breath came in shallow gasps as he stared at the building.

It filled every window, pushing against the fragile panes. Floor after floor, window after window, the same sight: Eli‚Äôs massive belly consuming every inch of space inside. The entire station seemed to freeze. Time itself felt suspended. David watched, his heart pounding in his chest. Then‚Äî BOOOOOM!!! The police station exploded outward in a shower of bricks, steel, and shattered glass. Walls disintegrated, the roof lifted off like paper. Debris rained down in every direction. And from the heart of the destruction, Eli‚Äôs enormous, bloated form surged free, finally unbound. His belly, now unimaginably vast, quivered slightly in the air. Perched atop it, Eli sat cheerfully, his legs dangling over the edge. He raised a hand and waved enthusiastically down at David. \"Heyyy, David!\" Eli‚Äôs voice boomed, echoing through the empty streets, innocent and joyful. David stared, mouth slightly open, as bits of debris clattered around him. \"...Oh, God,\" he whispered. The ground was littered with rubble, the air thick with dust.

Water exploded into the street in a violent surge, obliterating everything in its path. Cars were lifted and tossed like toys, streetlights snapped, and the shockwave of the blast rattled buildings for blocks.

Reluctantly, Eli closed his eyes and focused. A deep, bubbling grrrrmmmmbll echoed from within him. His belly suddenly began to shrink, wobbling slightly as it contracted. The round mass steadily pulled inward, the tight skin softening and deflating like a balloon. GRRROOOOOLL...

The smell of sweet fruit pies and buttery crusts filled the air, making Eli‚Äôs stomach grumble loudly. At the booth, a bored-looking volunteer glanced up. \"Pie-eating contest? Sign up here.\" David filled out the form as Eli practically vibrated with excitement. \"Name?\" the volunteer asked. \"Eli!\" he beamed. The volunteer gave him a quick look up and down‚Äîthin, lanky, and practically drowning in his loose hoodie‚Äîbefore shrugging and handing them a contestant badge. The contest area was already bustling with people gathering around a long table piled high with pies. The other contestants were lining up, sizing each other up. Most of them were large, middle-aged men, their bellies spilling over their belts. One of them, a towering man with an enormous gut that strained against his stained tank top, leaned back in his chair and let out a deep, rumbling laugh. \"Hey, kid!\" he bellowed, slapping his belly. \"You sure you‚Äôre in the right place? The lemonade stand is that way!\" The other contestants chuckled. Eli gave a small, polite smile, unfazed. Another man leaned over, smirking. \"Careful, kid. You might choke on a blueberry.\" But the massive man leaned in closer, grinning wickedly. \"Tell you what,\" he sneered, licking his lips. \"After I‚Äôm done with these pies, I‚Äôll save you for dessert.\" David stiffened, glaring. \"Real classy, pal.\" Eli just giggled. \"Hope you like eating dust.\" A loudspeaker crackled to life. \"Alright, folks! It‚Äôs time for the Annual Pie-Eating Contest! Ten minutes on the clock! Whoever eats the most pies wins a $500 prize and a year‚Äôs worth of bragging rights!\" The crowd roared with excitement. The contestants were each seated in front of towering stacks of pies. Eli took his seat at the far end of the table, barely able to sit still. David stood in the crowd, arms crossed with a smug grin. \"On your marks... get set... GO!\" Eli exploded into action. Without hesitation, he grabbed the first pie with both hands and shoved it into his mouth. Crust and filling vanished as he inhaled it in seconds. GULP. Gone. Another pie. GULP. And another. GULP. The crowd gasped, then erupted into cheers. The other contestants froze, mid-bite, staring in shock. \"Wh-what the hell?!\" one of them sputtered. Even the massive man who had taunted Eli paused, pie halfway to his mouth. Eli didn‚Äôt notice. He was already five pies in, barely slowing down. The volunteer staff scrambled, barely managing to keep Eli‚Äôs stack full. \"Get more pies! We‚Äôre running out!\" one of them shouted. The audience was going wild, chanting his name. \"ELI! ELI! ELI!\" Eli‚Äôs hands were a blur, his cheeks puffed out as he devoured pie after pie. Filling smeared his face, crust crumbs dusted his hoodie, but he didn‚Äôt stop. The big man next to him was still struggling through his third pie, sweat pouring down his face. \"Th-this... this is insane!\" he muttered, staring in disbelief. Minutes passed in a blur of cheering and frantic pie stacking. \"Ten seconds left!\" the announcer shouted. Eli shoved another pie into his mouth. \"Three... two... one... TIME!\" The horn blared. Eli sat back, letting out a small, satisfied sigh. The judges scrambled to count the empty pie tins. \"Thirty-six pies!\" one judge shouted in disbelief. The crowd erupted. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve, grinning wide. David let out a low whistle, clapping slowly. The enormous man who had taunted him slumped in his chair, staring at Eli in shock.

His bloated, heavy belly burst free, the pale, stretched skin glistening in the dim light.The surface shifted slightly, something inside pushing outward before slowly settling.Eli gave his bare, round belly a slow, affectionate rub.\"Told you I‚Äôm still hungry,\" he muttered, a wicked grin curling on his lips.---A few minutes later, Eli waddled casually back toward David, his bare, swollen stomach bouncing with each step.David, waiting near the contest tent, blinked in shock.\"Whoa. Okay, first off, what the hell happened to your hoodie?!\"Eli grinned, lazily patting his massive, round belly.\"It couldn‚Äôt handle me,\" Eli said simply, stretching his arms overhead.David stared at the exposed, bulging gut, noticing how it shifted slightly beneath the skin.Then David‚Äôs eyes narrowed.He glanced around the fairgrounds.No sign of the massive man.David‚Äôs eyes flicked back to Eli‚Äôs belly.It moved‚Äîjust barely.David slowly lowered his hand to his side.\"You didn‚Äôt.\"Eli chuckled, running a hand across the taut curve of his stomach.\"He started it.\"David let out a groan, dragging his hand down his face.\"You can‚Äôt just eat people every time they insult you!\"Eli smirked. \"Worked, didn‚Äôt it?\"David stared at him for a moment, then sighed in defeat.\"Let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ go to the food stalls before you eat the mayor or something.\"Eli grinned brightly. \"Now that sounds like a plan!\"And with his bare, swollen belly wobbling in front of him, Eli happily followed David toward the endless rows of food stalls, licking his lips in anticipation.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.davidStretchedHi.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Food stalls rampage¬†",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.davidStretchedHi.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.5.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theFairgroundsWe"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliAndDavidStrol":[["^Eli and David strolled through the crowded fairground, Eli‚Äôs enormous, bloated belly swaying heavily with every step. His shirt was stretched thin over his swollen gut, barely holding together after their last feast. David glanced over at him with a smirk. \"Still hungry?\" Eli grinned, lazily rubbing his distended stomach. \"I could go for something crispy.\" His eyes locked onto the corn dog stand just ahead. The scent of sizzling batter and juicy sausages filled the air. Behind the counter, two young women worked the fryer. One of them, a brunette with a ponytail, was flipping corn dogs in the oil while her blonde friend handled the customers, laughing and chatting. Eli narrowed his eyes, thoughtfully patting his belly. David caught his expression. \"Oh no. What are you thinking?\" Eli smirked. \"I can‚Äôt exactly pull off the whole 'skinny guy challenge' routine with this thing,\" he said, giving his massive belly a pat. \"But‚Ä¶ I have an idea. You‚Äôre gonna need to help me out.\" David sighed but cracked his neck, a grin creeping across his face. \"Fine. Let‚Äôs have some fun.\" Eli slipped quietly behind the stand, vanishing into the shadows. David casually approached the counter, flashing a confident, easygoing smile. \"Hey there,\" he said smoothly, his voice low and inviting. The blonde girl glanced up‚Äîand froze. Her eyes flicked from David‚Äôs broad shoulders to the way his shirt stretched across his chest. \"Oh, uh, hey!\" she stammered, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. David leaned in just slightly. \"Busy night?\" he asked, glancing at the fryer. She giggled nervously. \"Yeah, pretty crazy. But, y‚Äôknow, fun.\" David smiled, glancing over his shoulder, then back at her. \"Listen‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been working hard. How about you take a little break? Maybe come chat with me for a minute?\" She hesitated, biting her lip. \"I‚Äîuh‚Ä¶ well, I guess my friend can handle it for a bit.\" David leaned in a little closer. \"Come on, just a few minutes.\" Her hesitation melted. \"Okay, but just for a second.\" David gestured casually behind the stand. \"Right this way.\" She followed him without a second thought, disappearing behind the stall. Moments later‚Äî GLLLUUUUUUUURRRP! A deep, wet gulp echoed faintly from behind the stand. David casually strolled back to the counter where the brunette was still frying corn dogs, unaware. \"Hey, uh‚Ä¶ your friend might‚Äôve twisted her ankle back there,\" David said, pointing behind the stand. The brunette‚Äôs head shot up. \"What?\" David nodded. \"Yeah, she‚Äôs sitting down, says it really hurts. Maybe you should check on her.\" Concern flickered in the girl‚Äôs eyes. \"Oh my God!\" she gasped, quickly setting the tongs aside. Without another word, she rushed toward the back. Seconds later‚Äî GLLLOOOORRRP! Another heavy gulp. David exhaled slowly, glancing over his shoulder. Moments later, Eli emerged from behind the stand, his belly now even larger, visibly shifting as something‚Äîor someone‚Äîmoved inside. Eli gave his wobbling gut a satisfied pat, smirking. \"Mmm‚Ä¶ needed that.\" David chuckled. \"Well,\" David nodded at the now unattended stand, \"time to finish the job.\" Without hesitation, Eli leaned over the counter and plowed into the trays of fresh corn dogs. CRRUNCH! SLUUURRRP! He grabbed entire skewers and shoved them into his mouth, sticks and all. Grease dripped from his chin as the golden batter crunched between his teeth. Tray after tray disappeared. Not satisfied, Eli vaulted over the counter and tore into the supplies in the back‚Äîraw sausages, batter, oil, everything. GLOOOOORRRP! Moments later, the stand was completely empty. Eli slowly waddled back around the front, his belly now dragging low, straining with the weight of his feast.

David, close behind, grinned when he spotted the sign. \"Oh, man. That‚Äôs calling your name!\" Eli rubbed his belly and smirked. \"Let‚Äôs make this interesting.\" They approached the counter where a scruffy man in a grease-stained apron was tossing dough. He looked up as Eli leaned forward, his belly pushing against the counter. \"So‚Ä¶ if I eat one of those, it‚Äôs free?\" Eli asked casually. The man chuckled when he glanced at Eli‚Äôs already round gut. \"Yeah, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre walking away with a free pizza today. You look like you‚Äôve already stuffed yourself half to death.\" Eli just grinned. \"And what if I eat two? Do I get both free?\" The man smirked, raising an eyebrow. \"Sure, kid. Knock yourself out. But you won‚Äôt even finish one.\" David laughed, giving Eli an encouraging pat on the back. \"Easy money, man. Show him how it‚Äôs done.\" \"HEY! GET TWO OF THE BIG ONES GOING!\" the man shouted into the back. Minutes later, two massive, three-foot pizzas were wheeled out, steam rising from the gooey cheese and thick toppings. A small crowd began to gather, intrigued by the challenge. Eli cracked his knuckles and grinned. \"Let‚Äôs do this.\" Without hesitation, Eli grabbed half of the first pizza and rolled it up like a giant burrito. The vendor‚Äôs smirk faltered. \"Wait, what are you‚Äî\" CRRRUNCH! SLUUUURP! Eli shoved the rolled pizza into his mouth, tearing into it in massive bites. Cheese and sauce dripped down his chin as the doughy roll vanished. David chuckled, leaning on the counter. \"Man, you don‚Äôt waste time!\" The man behind the stand leaned forward, blinking in disbelief. \"No way‚Ä¶\" The first pizza was gone in under five minutes. Eli licked his lips and dove into the second. Halfway through, he called out between bites, his mouth still full. \"You... better... start making more!\" The man scowled. \"Hey! That‚Äôs not how this works! I‚Äôm not running a charity here!\" Eli‚Äôs eyes narrowed, and he gave his belly a slow, deliberate pat. \"Unless you want me to eat your whole stand,\" Eli said with a cold grin, \"you should get moving.\" The man paled, then snapped over his shoulder. \"FIRE UP MORE DOUGH!\" And so, the pizzas kept coming. Third. Fourth. By the fifth, sweat was pouring down the vendor‚Äôs face as he scrambled to keep up. \"How the hell is he still eating?!\" David laughed. \"He‚Äôs just getting started!\" The eighth pizza was devoured. The ninth disappeared in massive, sloppy gulps. When Eli reached the tenth, his belly groaned and bulged, stretching far out in front of him. Then‚Äî The loudspeaker crackled to life. \"ATTENTION FAIRGOERS! THE PIE-EATING CONTEST WILL BEGIN IN 15 MINUTES!\" David‚Äôs head shot up. \"Eli! That‚Äôs your event!\" Eli froze mid-bite, staring at the remaining pizza. His face twisted into a pout. \"But...\" he whined, glancing at the stack of freshly baked pizzas. David grinned. \"Come on, man. Time to win another prize!\" Eli grumbled but didn‚Äôt leave just yet. He finished the tenth pizza in two massive bites. Then, without breaking eye contact with the stunned vendor, Eli leaned forward, wrapped his arms around the stack of fresh pizzas waiting to be served, and in one massive GLOOORRRP, swallowed the entire stack whole. The crowd gasped. David burst out laughing. \"Okay, now we can go.\" Eli wiped his mouth and gave his bloated belly a satisfied pat. \"Fine,\" Eli mumbled, turning to waddle toward the contest tent, his stomach bouncing heavily with each step.

A small crowd was already gathering, eager to watch the spectacle. Contestants were beginning to line up, mostly large, burly men in stretched-out shirts and suspenders, boasting and laughing loudly as they eyed the competition. One man, in particular, stood out among them. A massive, towering figure with a belly spilling out from under his too-small tank top, arms crossed and a smug grin on his face. \"Look at this bunch of lightweights!\" he bellowed, patting his stomach with a loud THUMP. \"Ain‚Äôt nobody here gonna beat this!\" He grinned widely, turning to the others. \"You‚Äôre all lookin‚Äô at the winner, boys! This gut‚Äôs been trained for this moment!\" Some of the other contestants laughed nervously, others rolled their eyes. Then the crowd's murmuring grew louder. Heads turned. \"Whoa‚Ä¶\" \"Look at that guy!\" Eli and David approached the registration table, drawing every eye in the tent. Eli's belly was enormous, wobbling heavily with each step. His hoodie was stretched beyond recognition, barely clinging to his sides, while his massive, round gut bounced in front of him like a wrecking ball. The contest area fell into stunned silence. The registration volunteer blinked rapidly as Eli casually leaned on the table. \"Uh‚Ä¶ n-name, please?\" she stammered. \"Eli,\" he said with a wide grin, giving his belly a slow, satisfied rub. The volunteer swallowed hard and scribbled his name down. David leaned in with a smirk. \"You sure he‚Äôs allowed to compete?\" The woman gave a weak laugh but nervously passed Eli his contestant badge. Meanwhile, the burly man at the end of the table had turned, his grin faltering. His eyes locked on Eli‚Äôs massive belly, and his face turned beet red. \"*What the hell is that?!\" he blurted out. The crowd chuckled. Eli smiled sweetly. \"Just here to have some fun,\" Eli said, rubbing his bloated gut. The big man scowled, fists clenching at his sides. \"Pfft, you ain‚Äôt gonna last five minutes, balloon boy.\" Eli chuckled softly. \"Guess we‚Äôll see, huh?\" The announcer‚Äôs voice crackled over the loudspeaker. \"ALRIGHT, FOLKS! THE CONTEST IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\" Contestants took their seats, trays of pies placed in front of them. The burly man grunted as he sat down, cracking his knuckles. Eli carefully squeezed behind the table, his belly bumping against it with a heavy THUD. \"ON YOUR MARK‚Ä¶ GET SET‚Ä¶ GO!\" The tent exploded with cheering. Contestants lunged at their pies, stuffing crust and filling into their mouths. But Eli was a machine. CRRRUNCH! He grabbed entire pies with both hands, shoving them into his mouth‚Äîbarely chewing before swallowing. SLUUURRRP! GLOOOORRRP! Crust, filling, tins‚Äîit all vanished. The burly man‚Äôs eyes widened as he slowed, struggling halfway through his second pie. \"What the‚Äî\" Eli was already ten pies in.

The burly man grunted, sweat pouring down his face as he stared in disbelief. \"NO WAY!\" \"TIME!\" the announcer shouted. The buzzer blared. The crowd roared as judges scrambled to count. \"Thirty-four pies!\" \"HE WINS!\" Eli leaned back, licking crumbs off his fingers, his belly even larger, groaning under the weight of his victory. The burly man slammed his fists on the table, fuming. \"This is rigged!\" he barked, but no one was listening. David clapped loudly. \"Champion!\" Eli chuckled, giving his bloated belly a proud pat. \"That was fun.\" But then, his eyes drifted to the leftover pies scattered across the tables.

His bare, bloated gut glistened with sweat, wobbling slightly as he stopped a few feet away. Eli grinned. \"Not so confident now, are you?\" The man‚Äôs fist clenched around the cigarette. \"What do you want?\" he spat. \"Come to rub it in?\" Eli chuckled, patting his belly with a slow, heavy thud. \"Nah. Just thought we could‚Ä¶ finish what you started.\" The man sneered. \"What‚Äôs that supposed to mean?\" Eli‚Äôs eyes darkened. \"Exactly what you think it means.\" Before the man could react, Eli lunged forward with terrifying speed for someone his size. \"HEY‚Äî\" GLLLLOOOOORRRPP! The man‚Äôs scream was cut off as Eli‚Äôs mouth stretched impossibly wide, engulfing him in one massive gulp. His massive frame struggled for a split second, fists pounding uselessly against Eli‚Äôs bloated gut‚Äî Then‚Äî GULP. Gone. Eli leaned back with a satisfied sigh, wiping his mouth. His belly quivered and expanded even larger, stretching taut and round. A faint bulge pushed outward, an arm or leg struggling from within before sinking back into the massive dome of flesh. Eli rubbed his swollen gut lazily. \"Now that‚Äôs better.\"Back at the Contest Tent David glanced toward the tent‚Äôs edge, still casually waiting. \"Man, he‚Äôs taking forever,\" David muttered. Moments later, Eli waddled back into view, his belly now even bigger, swaying dangerously low to the ground. David raised an eyebrow. \"Uh... what did you do?\" Eli just grinned, giving his enormous gut a slow, satisfied pat. \"Handled it.\" David stared for a second, then smirked. \"Yeah, I‚Äôm not even gonna ask.\" \"Good.\" Eli glanced around the fair, his appetite still not satisfied. \"So‚Ä¶ where to next?\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.behindTheContest.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Further into the fair",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"County_Fair_2.behindTheContest.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.theFairgroundWas"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBustlingNoise":[["^The bustling noise of the fairground faded as Eli‚Äôs towering, bloated form lumbered toward the vegetable market.Stalls lined the path, overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables‚Äîbright red tomatoes, baskets of apples, piles of leafy greens, and stacks of pumpkins.

With a low grunt, he squeezed through the gap, his massive stomach getting stuck for a moment before he forced his way in with a loud THUMP.Inside, the dimly lit space was alive with eerie sounds‚Äîcackling laughter, creaking doors, and the occasional distant scream from the ride‚Äôs sound effects.Eli paused, blinking in the gloom as his eyes adjusted.\"Spooky,\" he mumbled sarcastically.Slowly, he began waddling deeper into the ride, squeezing between props and low-hanging decorations.Following the rickety tracks, Eli eventually reached the end of the ride where the carts were supposed to emerge from the dark tunnel.He positioned himself next to the tracks, belly swaying slightly as he stood still, blending into the eerie atmosphere.Moments later, a cart rolled toward the exit.A young couple sat inside, laughing and holding onto each other.\"Ahh!\" the girl squealed as a mechanical skeleton lunged toward them.They both laughed‚Äîuntil their eyes caught the looming figure of Eli standing motionless by the tracks.\"Oh wow,\" the guy chuckled nervously. \"Is that part of the ride?\"The girl squeezed his arm. \"That thing looks real!\"Eli didn‚Äôt move.Then, slowly, a wide grin spread across his face.And his mouth began to stretch open.WIDER.IMPOSSIBLY WIDE.\"Wha‚Äî\"GLLLUUUURRRRPPP!The couple vanished in one massive gulp, the cart clattering forward completely empty. David stood casually near the entrance of the Haunted Mansion, watching as excited fairgoers climbed into the small, creaky carts. Laughter and playful screams echoed from inside as the carts disappeared into the dark ride. But David‚Äôs smirk grew when the first empty cart rolled out of the exit. Then the second. Then the third. The ride operator blinked, staring at the growing line of empty carts slowly creeping along the track. \"Wait‚Ä¶ what the heck?\" he muttered, leaning into his control booth. He grabbed his radio. \"Control, this is Ride Four. I‚Äôm getting empty carts coming out. Can we check the cameras?\" Static. \"Control?\" Nothing. The operator‚Äôs face tightened. \"Hold the ride!\" he barked to his assistant. The carts stopped with a mechanical clunk, leaving several still trapped inside the dark maze of the ride. \"I‚Äôm sending tech in. Something‚Äôs jammed up.\" Two technicians, both wearing branded vests and holding flashlights, exchanged uneasy glances. \"Probably a prop fell on the tracks,\" one muttered, but his voice lacked conviction. David watched them disappear into the dark entrance, the black tunnel swallowing them whole. Inside the Haunted Mansion The air was thick with mechanical groans, eerie music, and the artificial fog that clung to every surface. Dozens of carts had stalled along the tracks, leaving groups of fairgoers sitting in the dark. \"Uh, why did we stop?\" one rider whispered. \"It‚Äôs part of the ride,\" another chuckled nervously. \"Right?\" But the shadows seemed to grow darker. Then came a sound. THOOM. Heavy, slow steps echoed in the darkness. \"What is that?\" \"Hello?\" The ground trembled slightly as Eli's massive form moved between the carts, his enormous belly brushing against the walls and the ride props, rattling the sets. A soft, low chuckle reverberated through the dark. Then‚Äî GLLLUUUURRRPP! A startled scream was cut off in an instant. \"Did you hear that?!\" \"Where did they go?!\" GLOOOOORRP! Another cart went silent. One by one, the sounds of confused and frightened whispers were replaced by heavy gulps echoing through the halls. The technicians turned a corner, flashlights cutting through the dark. \"Hey!\" one called out. \"Everything okay in here?!\" No answer. Just the sound of something moving toward them. Slowly. Steadily. THOOM. THOOM. \"Oh my‚Äî\" SLUUUUUURRRP! Silence. The only remaining sounds were the eerie music looping on the speakers and the soft mechanical creaks of the halted ride.Outside the Haunted Mansion David leaned casually against a fence, watching the entrance. The operator was furiously clicking switches. \"Come on, why isn‚Äôt anyone answering?\" He pressed the radio button harder. \"Mike? Sarah? What‚Äôs going on in there?!\" Static. \"Control, we need backup at Ride Four. We‚Äôve got a situation‚Äî\" The radio crackled, then fell silent. David chuckled quietly, shaking his head. \"Yep,\" he muttered, \"definitely a situation.\" Moments later, something massive shifted behind the tent. The canvas rustled. And then Eli lurched into view from behind the ride, his belly now colossal, dragging along the ground. It was even larger than before, impossibly round and bulging. Underneath the taut, stretched skin, faint shapes pressed and shifted‚Äîarms, legs, entire bodies faintly outlined, slowly sinking deeper into the bloated mass. David smirked. \"So‚Ä¶ how‚Äôd it go?\" Eli let out a heavy, satisfied sigh, wiping sweat from his forehead. \"Nice place,\" Eli mumbled, patting his enormous gut. \"Kinda cramped, though.\" A faint crackling noise suddenly echoed from deep within the stretched mass of his gut.\"...Mike? Sarah? Come in! Can anyone hear me?!\"The panicked voice of the ride operator buzzed through, muffled and distorted, as if coming from a radio buried deep inside Eli‚Äôs stomach. David froze for a second, staring at Eli‚Äôs belly in disbelief.Then he burst out laughing, doubling over.\"Oh my God,\" David wheezed. \"Did you just eat the radio?!\"Eli blinked in surprise, then grinned and gave his belly a satisfied pat.\"Guess it came with the meal.\"David could barely breathe from laughing.\"Man,\" he chuckled, \"*you are something else.\"Eli smirked. \"Well,\" Eli groaned, giving his belly a slow rub, \"I think I‚Äôve had enough haunted houses for one day.\" \"So... the animal market now?\" David teased.

Fat pigs rolled in the mud, fluffy sheep lazily chewed hay, clucking chickens pecked at the dirt, and rows of soft, wide-eyed rabbits twitched their noses from behind wire cages. Farmers and vendors proudly showcased their animals, calling out prices to curious customers. David glanced around, hands in his pockets. \"Huh,\" he mused. \"You wanted to come here. So, what now? Pet a goat?\" But Eli wasn‚Äôt listening. His heavy breathing slowed, and his eyes glazed over as he stared at the pens of animals.

The pig's squeal cut off instantly. \"OH MY GOD!\" Panic spread through the crowd. \"RUN!\" Eli didn't even glance at the fleeing people. He turned to the next pen. GLOOOORRP! A panicked sheep disappeared into his gaping maw, wool and all. \"HE'S EATING THE ANIMALS!\" Vendors scrambled to unchain pens and release the animals, but Eli was faster. CHOMP! SLUUURP! Chickens flapped wildly, only to be scooped up and swallowed in bunches, feathers sticking to Eli‚Äôs lips. A row of rabbits in their cages didn‚Äôt stand a chance. Eli tipped the entire stack over and devoured them, cages and all. David could only watch in horrified disbelief. \"Eli, STOP! What are you doing?!\" But Eli was beyond reason. His massive belly expanded more and more, bulging outward as it sloshed with the weight of dozens of animals. Vendors fled, pulling children away, screaming for help. But Eli didn't care. One by one, every pig, sheep, chicken, and rabbit was devoured. Minutes later, the animal market was silent. Eli stood in the wreckage, breathing heavily. His stomach was now colossal, dragging along the ground, wobbling dangerously with every slight movement.

David cautiously approached, scanning the destruction. \"Okay, Eli,\" David started carefully, \"I think you‚Äôve‚Äî\" But Eli wasn‚Äôt listening. His gaze drifted to the bustling food stalls in the distance. Rows of stands filled with sizzling meats, towers of sweets, and frosty drinks still operated, oblivious to the devastation nearby. Eli's stomach gave a deep, ominous GROOOOAN. \"Oh no,\" David muttered. \"Not again.\" But it was already too late. \"I‚Äôm not finished yet,\" Eli growled, his voice thick with hunger.The Feast Unleashed Eli charged, his titanic belly swaying violently as he plowed into the food court. \"RUN! RUN!\" Vendors screamed as Eli smashed through their stands like a wrecking ball. He tore into the BBQ stand first, ripping entire racks of ribs and brisket off the smoker. CRRUNCH! GLOOOORRP! Bones, sauce, and all‚Äîgone. The massive burger stand was next. Eli flipped the entire cart over, causing patties and buns to scatter across the dirt. SLUUURRRP! Trays of burgers, full loaves of bread, even entire wheels of cheese‚Äîall devoured. THOOM! He stomped over to the corn-on-the-cob stand, grabbing full crates of butter-drenched corn and pouring them into his mouth. CHOMP! GULP! Hot, buttery corn spilled down his chin as he swallowed whole cobs without slowing. \"HE‚ÄôS EATING EVERYTHING!\" Vendors fled in every direction, abandoning their carts and screaming for help. But Eli kept moving. He reached the lemonade stand, grabbing the massive plastic containers of fresh lemonade and chugging them down, his throat working overtime. GLUURRRP! Cups, pitchers, ice‚Äîeverything vanished. David watched in stunned disbelief as Eli's belly grew larger, stretching tighter with each monstrous gulp. Eli stumbled toward the cotton candy stand, greedily yanking massive clouds of spun sugar off their sticks. SLORRRP! Fluffy pink and blue sugar dissolved instantly in his mouth. GLOOOORP! Not satisfied, Eli grabbed the spinning machine itself, tipping it over and slurping the remaining sugar straight from the source. The ground shook beneath him as he lumbered forward. Vendors and fairgoers screamed and scrambled to escape. The parking lot became a disaster as cars screeched and collided, desperate to flee.

The massive structure tipped and crashed to the ground in a spray of sparks. Eli's jaws stretched impossibly wide. GLLLUUUUUURRRRP! The entire Ferris wheel disappeared into his belly. David staggered back, unable to believe what he was seeing. \"Oh my God...\" But Eli wasn‚Äôt finished. He stormed toward the massive carousel, its lights flickering as it slowly spun. Eli grabbed the spinning platform and lifted it from the ground, horses and all, and tilted it back‚Äî SLUUUURRRP! Gone. \"HE‚ÄôS EATING THE RIDES!\" someone screamed. Fairgoers were sprinting in every direction now, their terrified screams blending with the screeching of metal and the cracking of wood. Eli‚Äôs enormous belly grew to monstrous proportions, ballooning outward, wobbling with every breath. And then‚Äî His eyes locked onto the towering Haunted Mansion. \"No,\" David whispered. \"ELI, STOP!\" But Eli didn‚Äôt hesitate. He smashed through the entrance, plowing through walls, props, and tracks. CRRRAAAASH! He devoured the entire structure piece by piece. GLOOOORRRP! Wood, metal, decorations‚Äîeverything vanished into his belly. Minutes later, there was nothing left. The entire fairground was gone. Every stall. Every ride. Every piece of the festival. All that remained was Eli, collapsed on his back in the middle of the flattened fairground. His belly was now an impossibly massive mountain, rising above him like a fleshy hill. It groaned and shifted, faint shapes pressing against the stretched skin before sinking deeper. David stood near Eli's head, looking tiny in comparison. \"Eli...\" David breathed, unable to form words. Eli let out a deep, sluggish groan. \"Uuuugh... now I think I‚Äôm full,\" Eli mumbled, lazily rubbing the side of his massive gut.

David watched nervously as Eli's massive form began lumbering toward the panicked crowd. \"Eli‚Ä¶\" David called out cautiously. \"Don‚Äôt.\" But Eli‚Äôs focus was razor-sharp. \"No one‚Äôs leaving.\" Eli‚Äôs stomach groaned in anticipation. Then, he charged. \"GO! GO! MOVE!\" \"IT‚ÄôS COMING THIS WAY!\" Cars slammed into each other, tires spun wildly, but it was no use. Eli grabbed the nearest car, effortlessly lifting it off the ground. The driver screamed inside as Eli tilted the vehicle back‚Äî GLLLLUUUURRRP! The entire car, metal and all, slid down his throat. \"NO! NO! GO BACK!\" Panicked drivers tried to reverse, but Eli was faster. He snatched another car, tilting it upright. GLOOOORRRRP!

David could only stare in horrified disbelief. \"Eli, STOP!\" But Eli didn‚Äôt even hear him. One by one, every car in the parking lot was consumed. Metal crunched, glass shattered, and screams were cut off in massive, wet gulps. SLUUURRRP! Minutes later, the parking lot was empty. Not a single car. Not a single person. Only deep tire marks and cracked pavement remained. Eli stood there, his belly now grotesquely massive, stretching far beyond anything imaginable. But he wasn‚Äôt finished. Eli slowly turned back toward the fair. Vendors and remaining guests had barely begun to recover when Eli came charging back. \"RUN!\" \"HE‚ÄôS COMING BACK!\" Eli smashed through the rows of booths, devouring entire stalls‚Äî CRAAASH!

The spinning platform crumpled as Eli devoured it whole, horses and all. The Haunted Mansion‚Äîflattened and consumed. Every stand, every ride, every vendor, every guest. No one escaped. Eli consumed everything. The fairground fell into eerie silence. Screams and chaos had been replaced by an eerie silence, broken only by the distant sound of Eli‚Äôs labored breathing. He lay sprawled on his back in the middle of the flattened grounds, his belly now a grotesque, monstrous dome of flesh. It stretched impossibly high, rising like a fleshy mountain that dominated the landscape. His skin was pulled painfully taut, so thin in places it looked nearly translucent. Deep stretch marks spiderwebbed across the bloated surface, glowing red against the strain. Horrifying, wet groans and creaks echoed from deep inside his gut, followed by sharp, ominous pops of skin stretching to its limit. David stood beside Eli's head, looking tiny in comparison, his eyes wide with disbelief. \"Eli...\" David‚Äôs voice was barely more than a whisper. Eli‚Äôs face was pale and slick with sweat. His teeth were clenched tightly, his eyes squeezed shut. \"Nnngh...\" Eli groaned, his body trembling.

Eli winced, beads of sweat rolling down his face. \"I... I don't know how much more I can hold it...\" David‚Äôs face tightened in panic. \"Okay, okay, breathe. Just‚Äîhold it together, man!\" But even David wasn‚Äôt sure if Eli‚Äôs stomach could take another second. The enormous belly quaked, shifting dangerously, as if it might burst at any moment. Then‚Äî WEE-OOO, WEE-OOO. The distant wail of police sirens broke through the still air. David‚Äôs head snapped toward the sound.

Angry red stretch marks crisscrossed the swollen mass, and deep, unsettling bubbling sounds rumbled from within. David stood frozen by Eli‚Äôs head, his face pale as the flashing red and blue lights grew closer. Police cruisers skidded to a stop, sirens blaring. Doors slammed. Guns were raised. \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!\" an officer shouted. Another let out a sharp, nervous whistle. \"You've gotta be kidding me...\" The Chief stepped forward, his boots crunching on the dirt, megaphone gripped tightly in one hand, baton in the other. \"ATTENTION!\" his voice boomed through the megaphone. \"STEP AWAY FROM‚ÄîWHATEVER THAT THING IS!\" Eli let out a weak, strained groan. \"P-please... don't...\" The Chief sneered, lowering the megaphone. \"What the hell are you?\" Without warning, he marched forward and jabbed his baton into Eli‚Äôs belly.

Then‚Äî KAAAAA-THOOOOOOM!!! The explosion was cataclysmic. A deafening shockwave ripped through the air, splitting the ground apart. A searing blast of force erupted outward in all directions, flattening everything in its path. Police cruisers were launched like missiles, spiraling through the sky before disappearing beyond the horizon. Officers were catapulted into the air, their bodies flung miles away, vanishing as tiny specks against the sky. David was hurled backward, his silhouette rocketing into the clouds until it was swallowed by the sky.  A hurricane of debris shot outward, a swirling storm of wood, metal, and dust. When the dust finally began to settle, there was nothing left. No people. No structures. No sound. Only a massive, smoking crater carved deep into the earth‚Äîsilent and still. The fairground had been erased. And above the smoldering pit, the distant echo of the explosion rumbled into silence.","\n","^<strong>\"Guess Eli just won the prize for biggest explosion.

David leaned back comfortably, absentmindedly scrolling through his phone, while Eli lay sprawled beside him, lazily flipping through TV channels. David smirked slightly, eyes still on his phone. \"You know... I've been planning something. A little surprise.\" Eli's head snapped towards him, eyes gleaming with curiosity. \"A surprise? What kind of surprise?\" David shrugged, playing it cool. \"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.\" David smirked, still staring at his phone. \"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.\" Eli's eyes narrowed with a mischievous glint. \"Oh, really? So you're just going to tease me like that?\" David chuckled, not even looking up. \"Yup.\" Eli leaned in closer, his grin spreading. \"Alright, fine. But you know what happens if you don't tell me?\" David raised an eyebrow, smirking. \"Oh? And what's that?\" Without warning, Eli slowly opened his mouth in an exaggerated, playful way, eyes locked on David's. He reached out and gently grabbed David's hand, bringing it toward his lips. \"Eli‚Ä¶\" David warned, though his voice was more amused than serious. Eli ignored him, smirking as he sensually wrapped his lips around David's fingers, sucking lightly on each one, his tongue teasing the spaces between. David let out a low breath, the smirk still on his face, though his eyes darkened slightly. \"You're ridiculous.\" Eli didn‚Äôt stop. He slowly pulled more of David's hand into his mouth, inching up until his entire palm disappeared past his lips. His eyes stayed locked on David's, daring him to react. David remained still, unfazed, though the slight shift in his seat and the growing tightness in his jeans betrayed how much the game affected him. Eli gave one last teasing suck before slowly pulling David's hand free with a wet pop. He leaned in, grinning wide. \"Tell me, or next time I won‚Äôt stop at your hand.\" David chuckled, shaking his head. \"If you eat me, Eli, you‚Äôll never find out what the surprise is.\" Eli groaned dramatically, flopping back against the couch. \"Ugh! You're no fun!\" David smirked, flexing his fingers as he relaxed again. \"Oh, I‚Äôm plenty of fun. You just have to be patient.\" The rest of the afternoon passed with David dropping vague hints and Eli throwing out increasingly ridiculous guesses, each more exaggerated than the last. But David remained stubbornly silent. Later that evening, after Eli finished his shower, he walked into the living room, towel still draped around his neck. His eyes immediately caught something on the coffee table‚Äîa sleek envelope tied with a deep red ribbon. Eli tilted his head. \"What's this?\" David was casually sitting on the couch, pretending to focus on the TV, but a sly smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. \"Oh, that? No idea. Must‚Äôve just appeared there.\" Rolling his eyes, Eli snatched the envelope and carefully undid the ribbon. He slid out a crisp certificate and stared at it for a moment, reading the elegant print. His jaw slowly dropped. \"No way... A three-week all-inclusive ocean cruise?!\" David finally turned to face him, grinning. \"Surprise.\" Eli was speechless for a few seconds before practically bouncing in place. \"David! This is insane! When do we leave? What kind of food do they have? Oh man, I bet they have endless buffets!\" David chuckled. \"We set sail next weekend. And yeah, endless food.

David followed behind him, rolling their suitcase with a relaxed smile. \"Calm down, Eli. The ship‚Äôs not going anywhere without us.\" Eli turned to him with wide eyes. \"David, this thing is huge! It‚Äôs like a floating city! Do you think they have a map or something? What if we get lost?\" David chuckled. \"That‚Äôs part of the adventure.\" Once they boarded, the scale of the ship truly hit them. Grand staircases, glittering chandeliers, and endless hallways stretched in every direction. The air buzzed with chatter and the distant sound of music. Their cabin was cozy yet modern, with a large window offering a stunning view of the ocean. Eli immediately flopped onto the bed, arms spread wide. \"Okay, this is already amazing. But where‚Äôs the food?\" David chuckled, setting their bag down. \"We just got here.

Long tables stretched endlessly, piled high with every kind of cuisine imaginable‚Äîpasta, seafood, grilled meats, endless desserts. The air was thick with mouthwatering aromas.

He was too busy devouring everything in sight‚Äîscooping pasta, tearing into ribs, and stuffing pastries into his mouth without pause. His eating was relentless.

Endless rows of steaming dishes stretched out before him‚Äîgrilled meats, creamy pastas, crispy fried treats, and desserts piled high. Eli‚Äôs eyes gleamed with excitement as he grabbed two trays and immediately began stacking them with reckless abandon. Mountains of food quickly formed on his plates‚Äîdouble helpings of everything. David trailed behind, watching with a mix of amusement and mild concern. \"Eli‚Ä¶ maybe pace yourself a little?\" But Eli was already seated, devouring food with unstoppable energy. He shoveled mouthful after mouthful, barely pausing to chew. Plates emptied in seconds, only to be replaced by more. His belly began to swell rapidly, rounding out as it strained against his shirt. The hem of his t-shirt crept higher until it barely covered the top of his stomach, leaving the smooth, tight skin fully exposed. As Eli kept eating, his gut expanded further, drooping between his legs, heavy and taut. GRRRRROOOOAAAANNNN The sound wasn‚Äôt just from Eli‚Äôs belly‚Äîit was from the nearby tables. Passengers had started to notice. Curious glances turned into sideways whispers. ‚ÄúIs he okay?‚Äù someone muttered. ‚ÄúLook at how much he‚Äôs eating‚Ä¶‚Äù another whispered. ‚ÄúHis stomach‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs massive!‚Äù David glanced around, noticing the growing attention. His eyes flicked back to Eli, who was still stuffing his face, cheeks puffed out, completely oblivious. \"Eli,\" David leaned in, his voice low but firm. \"Hey. Eli.\" Eli paused, cheeks full, eyes half-lidded in bliss. \"Mmm?\" David gestured subtly to the other guests, many now openly staring. \"You‚Äôre kind of putting on a show here. If you keep going like this, we‚Äôre going to get kicked out‚Äîor worse, people are going to start filming you.\" Eli blinked, looking around. He noticed the stares, the hushed voices. His bloated belly gurgled loudly, resting heavily between his legs, stretched so tight it seemed ready to pop. Eli groaned, leaning back, both hands slowly rubbing his enormous gut. \"Ughhh‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm still‚Ä¶ so hungry‚Ä¶\" David raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, well, maybe let‚Äôs not eat this entire buffet in front of everyone. How about we check out another one‚Äîspread it out a little‚Äîor maybe hit the cinema for a bit?\" Eli let out a long, exaggerated sigh, still gently rocking his swollen belly. \"Fine‚Ä¶ but only because my legs are going numb.\" David chuckled, standing up. \"Come on, let‚Äôs go before they bring out security.\" Eli groaned again, struggling to stand, his bloated stomach wobbling as he slowly got to his feet. He gave his belly one last, lingering rub. \"Okay, but I‚Äôm still getting popcorn if we go to the movies.\" David laughed. \"Of course you are.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBuffetHallWas1.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Different buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBuffetHallWas1.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The Movies",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBuffetHallWas1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theBuffetHallWas1.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSoftHumOfTheS"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theSecondBuffetH":[["^The second buffet hall was even grander than the first. The air was thick with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling meats, fresh bread, and sugary desserts. Endless food stations stretched in every direction‚Äîcarving stations, pasta bars, seafood towers, and dessert tables that looked like works of art. Eli‚Äôs eyes widened with excitement as they stepped in, his stomach letting out an eager grrrrgle. David placed a firm hand on Eli‚Äôs shoulder. \"Okay, listen. Maybe this time we take it easy. How about I bring the food to you? That way you‚Äôre not out there drawing attention to yourself.\" Eli blinked in surprise. \"Wait‚Ä¶ really? You‚Äôll bring me food?\" David smirked. \"Yeah. Just sit tight, and I‚Äôll keep the plates coming. It‚Äôs safer than letting you rampage through the buffet.\" Eli didn‚Äôt protest. He practically bounced into a booth near the corner, the soft cushions creaking as he sat down. He leaned forward eagerly, tapping his fingers on the table. \"Okay, okay! Go! I‚Äôm starving!\" David chuckled and made his way to the buffet stations. He returned with two full plates‚Äîone stacked with grilled meats and the other loaded with pasta and sides. Eli immediately dug in, devouring everything in record time. Forks scraped plates, and in less than a minute, both were spotless. Eli leaned back, pouting. \"That‚Äôs it? Two plates? David, you know that‚Äôs not enough!\" David sighed. \"Fine, I‚Äôll get more.\" As David got up, Eli‚Äôs eyes wandered. A few booths down, he spotted something that made him freeze mid-bite. An extremely obese couple sat in a corner booth, plates piled high in front of them. The man had to weigh at least 400 pounds, his stomach pressed against the table, while the woman beside him wasn‚Äôt far behind. Both were shoveling food into their mouths at a steady, relentless pace, barely pausing to breathe. Eli narrowed his eyes. \"They get to eat like that, but I can‚Äôt?\" he muttered under his breath. David returned with another pair of plates. Before Eli could dig in, he gestured toward the couple. \"David, look at them! They‚Äôre eating like machines, and I‚Äôm stuck here waiting for scraps!\" David followed Eli‚Äôs gaze and raised an eyebrow. He hadn‚Äôt noticed them before, but the way they devoured their food was something else. For a moment, David hesitated. Then he sighed. \"Okay, fine. You‚Äôve got a point.\" Eli‚Äôs eyes lit up. David smirked. \"I‚Äôll bring more this time. Just‚Ä¶ keep it quiet, alright?\" Eli clapped his hands excitedly. \"Now we‚Äôre talking!\" David started stacking plates higher, returning with four, then six plates at a time. Eli eagerly tore through each one, savoring every bite. David returned with another towering stack of plates, carefully balancing them as he approached the booth. Eli‚Äôs eyes sparkled with excitement, and without missing a beat, he dove back into the feast, devouring every bite with unrelenting speed. A few tables away, a young waiter stood by the drink station, absentmindedly wiping a glass. His eyes kept drifting toward Eli. He was tall and lean, with neatly styled dark hair and sharp features, but his usual professional demeanor seemed to falter. His gaze lingered on Eli‚Äôs relentless eating‚Äîthe way he tore through plate after plate, the subtle way his belly had started to round out under his shirt. There was something about Eli‚Äôs unashamed hunger, the casual confidence in how he indulged, that clearly fascinated him. The waiter‚Äôs grip on the glass tightened slightly, and a faint, curious smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. He quickly looked away when another server passed by but couldn‚Äôt help stealing another glance at Eli from the corner of his eye. Whatever it was, Eli‚Äôs appetite wasn‚Äôt just drawing attention‚Äîit was pulling him in.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^The obese couple notice competition",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The young waiter offers help",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.4.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str",{"VAR?":"joey"},"/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-2","flg":3},{"s":["^Famous encounter",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidHurriedBack"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH.0.c-2.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.4.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theBustlingNoise1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"thePoolDeckWasAl":[["^The pool deck was alive with energy‚Äîkids splashing in the water, people lounging on chairs, and the sounds of rushing water from various slides and fountains. Massive water slides twisted above, dumping excited riders into the pools below. Hot tubs bubbled in the corners, and fountains sprayed arcs of water across the bright, sunlit space. David and Eli stepped out onto the deck, now dressed in their swimwear. David looked relaxed in his swim trunks and towel slung over his shoulder, but Eli‚Ä¶ Eli looked downright ridiculous. His swim trunks clung awkwardly beneath the massive, round dome of his stuffed belly, which jutted out in front of him like an overinflated beach ball. The way it bounced slightly as he walked only added to the comical effect. David smirked, trying to hold back a laugh. \"You look like you swallowed the pool.\" Eli stuck his tongue out. \"Very funny. The water will help me digest!\" Before David could respond, Eli waddled toward the edge of the pool and launched himself into the water with a loud SPLASH! But the second he hit the water, something went terribly wrong. His massive, heavy belly dragged him straight down like a stone. BLUB-BLUB-BLUB! David's eyes widened. \"Eli?!\" Without thinking, David dove in after him, cutting through the water. He spotted Eli sinking awkwardly, limbs flailing in slow motion as bubbles escaped from his mouth. David grabbed Eli under his arms and kicked hard, pulling him back up. They burst through the surface, Eli gasping for breath. David coughed, dragging him toward the shallow end. \"Are you insane?! You sank like a rock!\" Eli wheezed, sputtering water, but grinned sheepishly. \"Guess‚Ä¶ guess I‚Äôm not as buoyant as I thought‚Ä¶\" David shook his head, helping Eli settle into the shallower water. \"Just stay where you can stand, alright?\" Eli nodded, still catching his breath. \"Yeah, yeah‚Ä¶ shallow water it is.\" Eli relaxed, playfully splashing water around and enjoying the coolness. David drifted off to swim a few laps, keeping a casual eye on him. Eli, meanwhile, was slowly drifting toward the far end of the pool, where the giant tubes of the water slides emptied riders into the water. He floated lazily, watching the streams of water splash down. Without realizing it, he got a little too close. Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught a blur of movement.","\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^WHEEEEEEEEEEEE! A high-pitched scream echoed from the water slide above. Before Eli could react, a girl shot out of the tube at full speed, skimming across the water‚Äîdirectly toward him. Eli barely had time to blink. Instinctively, his mouth dropped open in shock. FWUMP! The girl disappeared straight into his open mouth. Eli's cheeks bulged slightly, his eyes wide in surprise. He froze, processing what had just happened. Then‚Ä¶ slowly, a mischievous grin crept across his face. David, still swimming laps, hadn‚Äôt noticed a thing.

Posters for the latest movies lined the walls, but Eli's eyes were fixed on the concession stand, practically drooling. David sighed knowingly. \"Let me guess‚Äîyou want popcorn?\" Eli grinned wide. \"Popcorn, candy, nachos, and the biggest soda they have. Oh! And maybe some chocolate bars too!\" Moments later, the two of them staggered into the theater, arms overloaded with food. David carried two giant tubs of popcorn and two massive cups of cola, while Eli clutched piles of candy, nachos, and even a bag of gummy worms. They climbed all the way to the back row, settling into the far corner where they could spread out without being disturbed. The theater was mostly empty‚Äîjust a few scattered people here and there. As the trailers began rolling, Eli wasted no time. Crunch. Slurp. Munch. By the time the opening title of Dune appeared on the screen, Eli was already licking the chocolate off his fingers, surrounded by empty wrappers and a hollow popcorn tub. His slightly bloated belly peeked out from under his shirt, rising and falling as he let out a soft sigh. He nudged David. \"Hey‚Ä¶ can you go grab more?\" David gave him a deadpan stare. \"Seriously? Eli, the movie just started.\" \"But I‚Äôm still hungry!\" Eli whined, rubbing his belly dramatically. \"Come on, please? Just one more round!\" David groaned. \"You know, if you wanted to eat this much, we could‚Äôve gone back to the buffet.\" Eli pouted, giving him big, sad eyes. David rolled his eyes. \"Fine. But this is the last time.\" He carefully climbed over the row of seats and left the theater. At the concession stand, the cashier chuckled as David placed another massive order. \"Back so soon? Didn‚Äôt you just get all this?\" David rubbed his temple. \"Yeah, don‚Äôt ask.\" With both arms full of fresh popcorn buckets and oversized sodas, David made his way back to the theater. David pushed open the heavy theater door, carefully balancing two oversized buckets of popcorn and massive sodas in his arms. The familiar scent of buttery popcorn filled the air, but something felt‚Ä¶ off. The theater was silent. When they had first sat down, there had been a few scattered people‚Äîcouples, solo moviegoers, quietly settling in for the film. But now, as David‚Äôs eyes adjusted to the dim light, he noticed something strange. The theater was completely empty. Except for Eli. Slumped in the very back row, Eli sat alone, staring intensely at the massive screen. David froze for a second. Where did everyone go? He started walking up the steps slowly. But halfway up, he stopped dead in his tracks. Eli‚Äôs belly was enormous. It ballooned out in front of him, so massive it swallowed up three seats in the row ahead. The metal armrests of the chairs were bent outward, some seats completely crushed under the weight. His gut stretched so far forward it nearly touched the seats in the next row. The dim glow of the movie screen flickered across Eli's round, taut belly, casting shadows that made it look even more ridiculous. David stared, eyes wide. \"Eli.\" Eli didn‚Äôt move, pretending to be completely absorbed in the movie. David narrowed his eyes and climbed the remaining steps, stopping right beside him. \"Eli. What. Did. You. Do?\" Eli slowly turned his head, cheeks flushed red. \"W-what? I‚Äôm just watching the movie!\" David gestured at the destroyed seats and Eli‚Äôs gigantic belly. \"Oh, really? Because it looks like you ate the audience.\" Eli gave a sheepish grin, awkwardly patting his massive stomach. \"They were blocking my view!\" David‚Äôs jaw dropped. \"Blocking your‚Äî Eli! They were sitting scattered around the auditorium!\" Eli huffed, crossing his arms as best he could. \"Well, now they‚Äôre not.\" David groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"If you keep this up, there won‚Äôt be anyone left on this ship! You know what? Go ahead and clear out the entire buffet, but stop eating people!\" Eli‚Äôs eyes lit up instantly. \"Really?\" Before David could take it back, Eli snatched the snacks from his hands and inhaled them in seconds‚Äîpopcorn, soda, candy, all gone. His massive belly gave a deep, content gurgle. Then Eli gripped the armrests, trying to rock himself forward. \"Okay! Let‚Äôs go to the buffet!\" David stared at him, deadpan. \"You cannot walk out there like that.\" Eli blinked. \"Why not?\" David gestured to the colossal belly still crushing several rows of seats. \"Because if you waddle out with that, security will be here in five minutes! You need to do something about it.\" Eli slumped, frowning. \"Ugh‚Ä¶ do I have to?\" David crossed his arms. \"Yes. Either you shrink that thing down or we‚Äôre staying right here.\" Eli let out a loud, dramatic sigh. \"Fine‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm definitely getting more food after this.\" David rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just hurry up.\" Eli took a deep breath, grunted softly, and slowly started deflating. His massive belly groaned and gurgled as it shrank, the tight skin softening and retreating bit by bit. Once he was back to a manageable size, Eli sighed in relief. David smirked. \"Alright, let‚Äôs go.

Eli tore through the endless stream of dishes with wild, hungry energy, barely pausing to breathe. His stomach steadily grew, stretching his shirt tighter with each passing minute, rounding out under the table and creeping toward his knees. Across the room, a massively overweight couple sat hunched over their own overflowing table. The man had to weigh at least 400 pounds, his bloated stomach pressing firmly against the edge of the table, while his partner‚Äîonly slightly smaller‚Äîwas devouring her food just as aggressively. The man glanced up from his plate, catching sight of Eli‚Äôs feast. He nudged the woman beside him with his elbow, grunting as he nodded in Eli‚Äôs direction. Her eyes narrowed as she followed his gaze. Without a word, both of them leaned in, grabbed fistfuls of food, and began shoveling it in faster‚Äîchewing loudly, swallowing without pause. The woman grunted and heaved herself up, her thick legs wobbling as she shuffled toward the buffet. Her stretched dress clung to every curve, and the fabric creaked under the strain. She returned moments later with two trays stacked high with fried foods and dripping desserts. Eli noticed their sudden intensity and smirked to himself. Oh, so that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs gonna be? Challenge accepted. Eli leaned in, grabbing entire plates in both hands, stuffing his mouth without hesitation. David returned with more plates, barely able to set them down before Eli devoured them. \"Okay, this is getting ridiculous. I can‚Äôt carry it fast enough!\" Eli didn‚Äôt even answer, too busy eating, his belly swelling faster and rounder, pushing his shirt up over his skin. Across the room, the couple was struggling but determined. The man‚Äôs bloated gut strained against his shirt‚ÄîPOP!‚Äîthe front button shot off and clattered to the floor. He groaned but kept eating. His belt snapped next, the buckle swinging loose. His pants split slightly along the seams. The woman wasn‚Äôt faring much better. Her stretch dress was maxed out, the seams along her side beginning to tear with small, audible rips. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she forced down more cake. But it was no use. An hour passed, and the strain was too much. The man slumped back into the booth, groaning, his hands cradling his swollen gut. His shirt hung open, buttons gone, and his stomach heaved with each breath. The woman dropped her fork, gasping for air, her dress visibly torn at the sides. Both of them were utterly defeated. The man glanced over at Eli‚Äîwho was still going‚Äîand with a tired smirk, he raised a shaky thumbs-up. Eli leaned back, finally slowing down. His belly was enormous now, sagging heavily between his legs and practically touching the floor. His breathing was slow and deep, but a smug grin stretched across his face. As he lazily rubbed his monstrous stomach, Eli caught movement from the corner of his eye. The young waiter from earlier was still there, standing near the edge of the room, half-hiding behind a pillar. His eyes were locked on Eli, completely mesmerized by the display. Eli smirked, locking eyes with him for a second. And then, with a slow, playful wink, Eli let his hand slide across his swollen gut. The waiter blinked, startled, his face flushing red before he quickly looked away. Eli chuckled to himself. \"Hey, David,\" he mumbled, barely able to speak through his stuffed belly, \"I think I‚Äôm winning today.\" David, returning with yet another plate, stared at him and sighed. \"Yeah, yeah.

The mountain of empty plates around him was starting to attract attention. He let out a satisfied sigh, only for his stomach to let out a low, gurgling growl. Out of the corner of his eye, Eli noticed the young waiter from earlier lingering near the drink station. The guy had been sneaking glances for a while now, nervously fidgeting with his apron. But this time, the waiter took a deep breath and cautiously approached the table, clutching a notepad he clearly didn‚Äôt need. ‚ÄúH-hey,‚Äù the waiter stammered, his voice cracking slightly. ‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt help but notice you‚Äôre really enjoying the food here.‚Äù Eli grinned, eyes glinting with amusement. ‚ÄúYeah, you could say that.‚Äù The waiter chuckled nervously, shifting on his feet.

Knock yourself out.‚Äù The waiter beamed. ‚ÄúR-really? Great! I‚Äôll start right away!‚Äù As the waiter hurried off toward the buffet, Eli shook his head, laughing softly to himself. Right at that moment, David returned, balancing several plates. He paused mid-step, noticing the interaction. David raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúMaking friends now, are we?‚Äù Eli grinned. ‚ÄúLooks like I got myself a personal waiter.‚Äù David set the plates down and smirked. ‚ÄúOh, how charming. What‚Äôd you promise him, a bite of that belly?‚Äù Eli snorted with laughter. ‚ÄúPlease, this belly‚Äôs invite-only.‚Äù Moments later, the waiter reappeared with several heaping plates and carefully set them down in front of Eli, not even glancing at David. ‚ÄúHere you go! If you need more, just wave me over!‚Äù Eli casually grabbed a fork. ‚ÄúOh, trust me. I‚Äôll need more.‚Äù The waiter lingered for a moment, nervously shifting again. ‚ÄúS-so‚Ä¶ do you always eat like this?‚Äù Eli smirked mid-bite. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm good at what I do.‚Äù The waiter laughed softly, still clearly flustered. ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ if you run out of space, I can always bring smaller portions.‚Äù Eli grinned, picking up a fork. \"You know,\" he said between bites, \"I bet I could fit this entire ship in here.\"With that, Eli leaned back slightly and gave his massive belly a loud, proud slap.THWUMP.The sound echoed in the quiet buffet hall.The waiter froze mid-step, his eyes widening.

Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîwe should call it a night?\"Eli, still chewing, barely looked up. \"I‚Äôm not done yet.\"David groaned and leaned back. His eyelids were heavy, and his posture slouched. \"Unbelievable‚Ä¶\"He glanced at the young waiter, who looked equally worn out. His shoulders sagged, and his movements had slowed to a crawl.\"Hey,\" David called out, \"weren‚Äôt you supposed to be off your shift, like, hours ago?\"The waiter gave a weak chuckle, adjusting his apron. \"Yeah‚Ä¶ I was.

His steps grew heavier, and his eyes drooped, but he pushed on.Finally, on one of his last trips, the waiter returned with a tray barely held in his trembling hands.

Much narrower than Eli‚Äôs current girth.Eli blinked at the door, then down at his belly. \"Oh. Uh‚Ä¶\"David sighed. \"Perfect.\"The waiter rubbed his eyes and muttered, \"Okay‚Ä¶ on three. One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ three!\"Both David and the waiter pushed with all their strength. Eli grunted as his bloated body wedged into the doorframe. SCRRRTCHHH! With one last shove, Eli popped through, tumbling forward into the cabin with a loud THUD.David panted, leaning against the wall. \"I can‚Äôt believe that worked.\"The waiter, barely standing, gave a tired smile. \"Happy to help.\"David smirked. \"You should probably get some sleep. You‚Äôve earned it.\"The waiter nodded slowly, his eyelids drooping. \"Yeah‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll do that.\"Eli, sprawled out on the cabin floor, let out a contented sigh, hands resting on his massive belly. \"Night, guys‚Ä¶\"The waiter chuckled softly, turning to leave. \"Goodnight.\"As he staggered down the hallway, David closed the door behind him and shook his head. \"What a day.\"He glanced back at Eli, already dozing off. David chuckled to himself. \"Three weeks of this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna need a vacation after this vacation.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Breakfast buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT7.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theMorningSunStr1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBustlingNoise1":[["#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The bustling noise of the buffet was a chaotic symphony of clinking cutlery and murmured conversations. David sat at their table, eyeing Eli‚Äôs growing pile of empty plates with a mix of amazement and mild concern. But something caught his attention a few tables away.David leaned in, whispering, ‚ÄúEli, don‚Äôt look now, but‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that Joey Chestnut?‚ÄùEli froze mid-bite, his eyes narrowing. Slowly, he turned his head, pretending to stretch, and there he was‚Äîthe legendary competitive eater, seated in a booth with a group of friends, chatting and laughing over modest portions.Eli‚Äôs lips curled into a mischievous grin. ‚ÄúPathetic,‚Äù he muttered, already scheming.Rising from the table, Eli grabbed a tray and headed to the buffet line, loading it with burgers, hotdogs, and a towering pile of sides. On his way back, he deliberately walked past Joey‚Äôs booth, casting a haughty glance and smirking.‚ÄúSmall portions for a small stomach,‚Äù Eli said loudly enough for the table to hear. ‚ÄúPathetic capacity.‚ÄùJoey‚Äôs laughter stopped abruptly, his friends falling silent. His eyebrows furrowed, and he turned to look at Eli, who sauntered back to his table as if nothing had happened.One of Joey‚Äôs friends nudged him. ‚ÄúYou gonna let him say that?‚ÄùJoey stood up slowly, his face calm but his pride clearly wounded. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, rolling up his sleeves. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see who‚Äôs really pathetic.‚Äù The bustling buffet turned into a silent battleground as Eli and Joey squared off. The room buzzed with anticipation as word spread quickly about the impromptu eating contest. Diners whispered, waitstaff peeked nervously from behind counters, and even the kitchen staff had stopped to watch.Eli smirked, leaning casually over his already impressive mound of empty plates. Joey, in contrast, sat upright, his faded Nathan‚Äôs Famous t-shirt snug against his chest. His friends murmured encouragements, their confidence wavering as they eyed Eli‚Äôs growing collection of demolished trays. Joey started strong, grabbing two burgers at once and shoving them into his mouth with mechanical precision. His jaw moved like a machine, effortlessly breaking down each bite. THUD! The first empty tray hit the table, and his friends erupted into cheers.Eli wasn‚Äôt fazed. He leaned back, grabbed a towering burger from his tray, and swallowed it in three massive bites. ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù Eli teased, wiping his mouth. ‚ÄúFor an amateur.‚ÄùJoey‚Äôs jaw tightened. He grabbed a trio of hotdogs, dunked them in water, and stuffed all three into his mouth. The crowd gasped. His throat bulged as he swallowed, his belly starting to press visibly against the edge of the table.Eli, unfazed, grabbed a stack of sliders and shoved them in one by one, his gaze locked on Joey‚Äôs widening eyes. His belly swelled outward, pressing into the table with each new bite. By now, the air was thick with tension. Joey was visibly sweating, his friends nervously cheering him on as he grabbed another tray of burgers. His stomach, once flat and muscular, was rounding out, his t-shirt stretching tighter and tighter. Faint creaks came from his chair as it strained under the increasing weight.Eli leaned forward, his belly pressing comfortably into the table. He grabbed a heaping pile of fries, stuffing them into his mouth with both hands. ‚ÄúThis is barely a warm-up,‚Äù Eli taunted, patting his growing midsection.Joey, red-faced but determined, grabbed another burger and shoved it into his mouth. The veins on his forehead stood out, and his chest heaved as he swallowed hard. His stomach expanded even further, now pressing into the table with such force that the wood creaked ominously. Joey‚Äôs friends looked on in horror as his belly ballooned further. The Nathan‚Äôs Famous logo on his shirt was stretched beyond recognition. His breathing was ragged, and beads of sweat rolled down his face. He grabbed a hotdog with shaking hands, shoving it into his mouth despite his body screaming for him to stop.Eli, meanwhile, smirked and grabbed another burger. He popped it into his mouth with ease, patting his own bloated belly. ‚ÄúStill holding up, champ?‚Äù he taunted.Joey‚Äôs hands trembled as he reached for another burger. His friends begged him to stop.‚ÄúJoey, don‚Äôt!‚Äù one of them cried.But Joey shook his head. ‚ÄúNo way‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not losing to him.‚ÄùHe shoved the burger into his mouth. His stomach groaned audibly. GROOOOAAAAN. The entire room fell silent as Joey froze, his face twisting in discomfort.CRREEEEEAAAAKKK! His belly stretched even further, pressing against the edge of the table. His t-shirt strained to hold back the growing dome, faint tearing noises coming from the seams.‚ÄúJoey, stop!‚Äù his friend pleaded.Joey groaned, clutching the edge of the table. His eyes bulged, and for a moment, it looked like he was about to explode.RIIIIIIIIP‚ÄîPING!The sound echoed through the room as Joey‚Äôs t-shirt tore clean down the middle, the Nathan‚Äôs logo splitting apart. PING! His pants button shot across the room like a bullet, ricocheting off a tray. His stomach surged forward, finally free from its confines.Joey slumped back into the booth, his belly wobbling with the sudden release. His head tilted back, his arms limp at his sides. He was completely out, slipping into a food coma. Eli stood, raising his arms in triumph. ‚ÄúYESSS!‚Äù he roared, basking in the stunned silence of the buffet. He turned to Joey‚Äôs unconscious form and smirked. ‚ÄúPathetic eater,‚Äù he declared, loud enough for everyone to hear.The crowd erupted into murmurs, some laughing nervously, others shaking their heads in disbelief. David sighed, putting his face in his hands.‚ÄúEli,‚Äù David muttered, ‚Äúyou just had to make it a spectacle, didn‚Äôt you?‚ÄùEli grinned, grabbing a celebratory slice of pie. ‚ÄúWhat can I say?

The thrill of accidentally swallowing that girl sent a strange excitement through him. Now, curiosity got the better of him. Who else might come flying out? Moments later, the water gushed again, and another rider shot out of the tube‚Äîthis time a boy on an inflatable ring. FWUMP! Gone in an instant. Eli chuckled, licking his lips. \"This is way too easy.\" And so it continued. One by one, shrieking riders zipped out of the slide, only to disappear straight into Eli‚Äôs eagerly waiting mouth. A teenager. Then a couple. Even a man trying to make a big splash. FWUMP. FWUMP. FWUMP. Eli‚Äôs belly swelled larger with each gulp, ballooning rapidly. It grew so massive that it sagged beneath the water, spreading out and weighing him down. Soon, his stomach was so big it began breaking the surface, wobbling like an oversized beach ball. He giggled softly, rubbing the taut dome of his belly. \"Okay‚Ä¶ maybe this was a bit much...\" But his belly let out a deep, echoing groooaaaan, rippling through the water. From across the pool, David had just finished swimming laps when he spotted the massive, wobbling shape bobbing in the water. His eyes narrowed. \"Oh, for‚Äî\" David muttered under his breath and swam over, cutting through the water quickly. As he got closer, the full picture came into view: Eli‚Äôs belly was gigantic, round, and glossy, half-submerged and drawing stares from nearby swimmers. David‚Äôs jaw tightened. \"Eli. What. Did. You. Do.\" Eli‚Äôs face turned bright red. He splashed water toward David defensively. \"I-It was an accident!\" David crossed his arms. \"Another accident?\" \"I swear!\" Eli stammered, gripping the sides of his swollen belly. \"They just... kind of flew in! I couldn‚Äôt help it!\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You couldn‚Äôt help it? Eli, your stomach is practically a tourist attraction right now!\" Eli‚Äôs belly groaned again, sending a soft ripple through the pool. People nearby were starting to glance their way, whispering. David‚Äôs eyes darted around. \"Okay, we need to get you out of here. Now.\" Eli‚Äôs eyes widened in panic. \"David, I can't just waddle out with this thing! Everyone will stare!\" David cursed under his breath. He had a point. If Eli tried to get out now, his massive belly would draw even more attention. \"Okay, okay, think!\" David muttered. Eli gave his belly a tentative poke. \"What if‚Ä¶ we go to the hot tub? The bubbles might help, you know‚Ä¶ settle things.\" David gave him a flat look. \"You think a hot tub is going to fix this?\" Eli pouted. \"Or‚Ä¶ I could try to digest a little.

His eyes landed on a narrow, arched entrance tucked into the corner of the pool area. Soft, glowing lights shimmered from within, and the gentle hum of bubbling water echoed out.Curious, Eli floated toward it and slipped through the entrance, finding himself in a cozy artificial grotto. The walls mimicked rocky cave formations, with soft lighting casting warm reflections off the water. Along the edges, metallic grates on the pool floor released streams of bubbling water, creating built-in lounges for guests to relax.A few people were already reclined on the grates, enjoying the soothing jets. Eli grinned and carefully lowered himself onto one of the bubbling platforms.The moment he settled in, the jets roared to life beneath him, sending waves of bubbles rushing up against his massive, overstuffed belly. His bloated stomach jiggled and wobbled violently with every burst of air, the water rippling around it.The other guests slowly turned their heads. Eyes widened. Whispers began.\"Is that his stomach?\"\"How can someone even move with that thing?\"\"It‚Äôs like a giant balloon!\"Eli‚Äôs cheeks flushed bright red. He tried to relax, gently patting his belly as it bounced and shook with the bubbles. \"It's... just helping with digestion,\" he muttered under his breath.David leisurely finished his swim, enjoying the cool water and the peaceful atmosphere of the pool deck. Stretching out his arms, he took a deep breath and glanced around, expecting to spot Eli lounging somewhere or maybe splashing in the shallow end. But Eli was nowhere to be seen. David frowned. Where did he run off to now? He casually checked the snack bar‚Äîempty. The water slides‚Äînothing. He even glanced toward the lounge chairs, but no sign of Eli. David sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Seriously? How does someone with a belly like that just disappear?\" As he scanned the pool area again, his eyes caught a dimly lit, cave-like tunnel tucked away in a corner of the pool. Soft, glowing lights shimmered from inside, and faint bubbling noises echoed out. David tilted his head. \"Huh.\" Curiosity got the better of him, and he swam toward the narrow entrance, slipping into the artificial grotto. The water grew warmer, and the sound of bubbling jets became louder. But as soon as David entered, he stopped dead in his tracks. Right in the middle of the grotto, half-submerged in the bubbling water, was a massive, round belly, stretched so tightly it glistened under the soft lights. It wobbled slightly with the jets of water beneath it, dominating the entire space. David's eyes widened in pure shock. \"What the...?\" Slowly, his eyes traveled upward, and there was Eli‚Äîface bright red, awkwardly rubbing his enormous, bloated stomach. David could barely form words. \"Eli. What. Happened.\" Eli froze, his hands pressed against the towering dome of his gut. \"I-I can explain!\" David raised an eyebrow, disbelief written all over his face. \"Oh, please do.\" Eli stammered, clearly panicked. \"I was just‚Ä¶ relaxing! The bubbles felt nice, and‚Ä¶ and one thing led to another and‚Ä¶ I might have‚Ä¶ accidentally‚Ä¶\" David narrowed his eyes. \"Accidentally what?\" Eli shrank back, clutching his belly. \"Accidentally‚Ä¶ ate‚Ä¶ some people.\" David stared at him in stunned silence, then slowly looked around the empty grotto. \"You‚Äôre kidding me.\" \"I-I didn‚Äôt mean to!\" Eli whined. \"I was just lying here, and people kept floating too close and‚Äî\" David groaned, dragging a hand down his face. \"Eli. You have to stop doing this!\" \"I tried!\" Eli protested, giving his stomach a helpless jiggle. David took a deep breath to stay calm and glanced at the narrow tunnel behind him. Then back at Eli‚Äôs enormous, wobbling belly. His face paled. \"You‚Äôre not going to fit through that.\" Eli blinked, glancing nervously at the small entrance. \"Wait‚Ä¶ what?\" David gave him a deadpan look. \"That belly is not squeezing through that tunnel. You‚Äôre stuck here unless you‚Ä¶ you know.\" Eli's face turned even redder. \"No! I hate doing that!\" David crossed his arms. \"Well, unless you want to stay here until someone drains the pool, you don‚Äôt have a choice.\" Eli groaned miserably, rubbing his taut belly. \"Ugh‚Ä¶ fine! But I swear, I‚Äôm going to need so much more food after this!\" David rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just do it.\" Eli closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and with a soft grunt, his stomach slowly began to shrink. A deep gurgling noise echoed from within as his enormous belly gradually deflated, softening and pulling back toward a more manageable size. David watched with relief. \"There. Much better.\" Eli slumped forward, breathing heavily. \"That was awful...\" David smirked. \"Come on, let‚Äôs get out of here before someone notices.\" The two swam back through the narrow tunnel and emerged into the bustling pool area. Eli stretched, still looking drained but back to his normal size. After a moment, Eli perked up. \"Sooo‚Ä¶ since I‚Äôm, uh, empty now‚Ä¶ what if we hit up another buffet? Or maybe the cinema?\" David sighed, shaking his head with a smirk. \"Eli, you‚Äôre impossible.\" Eli grinned. \"Yeah, but you love it.\" David chuckled under his breath. \"Let‚Äôs go before you eat the entire ship.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Another buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^The Movies",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSecondBuffetH"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliSlowlyDrifted.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSoftHumOfTheS"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theBuffetHallWas2":[["^The buffet hall was a mess of empty plates, crumpled napkins, and the lingering scent of rich, heavy food. The obese couple who had been silently competing with Eli slumped back in their booth, utterly defeated. The man‚Äôs shirt was torn open, buttons scattered across the floor, and his belly heaved with labored breaths. His partner‚Äôs stretched dress was barely holding together, seams split along her sides. Eli, on the other hand, leaned back with a smug grin, his belly swollen and massive, sagging heavily between his legs and nearly touching the floor. From across the room, the young waiter had been watching the entire \"competition\" unfold, captivated by Eli‚Äôs relentless appetite. Slowly, he approached the booth, clutching his notepad more for comfort than necessity. ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù the waiter breathed out, eyes wide with admiration. ‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶ incredible. You completely destroyed them.‚Äù Eli smirked, rubbing his enormous belly. \"Yeah, I guess I did.\" The waiter chuckled nervously, glancing at Eli‚Äôs massive stomach before quickly looking away. \"You, uh‚Ä¶ you really know how to put it away.\" He hesitated for a second, then softly added, \"Mind if I‚Ä¶ help you out? Bring you more food, I mean. After a show like that, you deserve it.\" Eli raised a brow, noticing how the waiter‚Äôs hand lingered near his notepad. \"Sure, knock yourself out.\" The waiter‚Äôs face lit up, though a blush crept up his cheeks. Slowly, almost unconsciously, he reached out and let his hand gently brush against Eli‚Äôs stretched belly, fingers lightly gliding over the taut skin. \"You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ amazing,\" the waiter murmured, his voice barely audible. Eli chuckled, leaning back a little more. \"Careful. Keep touching me like that, and I might end up eating you too.\" The waiter‚Äôs breath caught, and Eli didn‚Äôt miss how the front of his pants visibly tightened. The poor guy pulled his hand back quickly, stammering, \"S-sorry! I‚Äôll, uh, I‚Äôll go grab more food!\" Eli smirked as the waiter practically ran off. David returned just in time to catch the scene. He raised an eyebrow, noticing the waiter hurrying away. \"Making more friends, are we?\" Eli laughed. \"What can I say? People appreciate talent.\" David shook his head, dropping off more plates. \"Yeah, seems like he appreciates more than just that.\" Over the next hour, the waiter kept returning with tray after tray of food, completely ignoring other customers. He would linger for a few moments each time, shyly asking, \"Still got room?\" Eli would grin and proudly pat his belly. THWUMP. \"Plenty. I could probably fit the whole buffet in here.\" The waiter‚Äôs knees nearly buckled at that, his face flushing bright red. \"I-I believe it!\" He brought even more food, sneaking shy glances at Eli as he devoured plate after plate. Eventually, the waiter couldn‚Äôt help himself and leaned in closer. ‚ÄúHow do you do it?‚Äù he asked, voice soft with awe. ‚ÄúHow can you fit so much?‚Äù Eli smirked. \"Let‚Äôs just say I was born with a special kind of talent.\" He gave his belly a slow, deliberate rub. \"And I‚Äôm always hungry.\" The waiter swallowed hard, his eyes locked on Eli‚Äôs belly. Eli noticed the growing bulge in his pants again and chuckled to himself. By now, it was nearly midnight. David, half-asleep in the booth, rubbed his eyes. \"Eli, it‚Äôs getting late. Maybe we should wrap this up before you eat the entire kitchen.\" The waiter, exhausted but still pushing himself, shakily placed one last tray on the table. His movements were sluggish, his eyelids drooping. Eli raised an eyebrow. \"You okay there, buddy?\" \"I-I‚Äôm fine,\" the waiter mumbled, swaying slightly. He leaned forward, as if to steady himself, and before anyone could react, he slumped forward‚Äîlanding face-first on Eli‚Äôs enormous belly. THUMP. David blinked, staring at the waiter now softly snoring on Eli‚Äôs gut. \"Well‚Ä¶ looks like you broke him.\" Eli chuckled. \"Oops.\" David sighed. \"Alright, that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre done for tonight.\" He gently shook the waiter‚Äôs shoulder. \"Hey, wake up.\" The waiter stirred, groaning softly. \"Huh? Oh‚Ä¶ s-sorry...\" David smirked. \"Come on, help me get this lump back to the room.\" Together, David and the groggy waiter struggled to haul Eli out of the booth. Eli groaned, wobbling as they half-pushed, half-dragged him through the empty hallways. When they reached the cabin, David froze. \"Oh, for‚ÄîEli, you‚Äôre not fitting through that door.\" Eli stared at the narrow doorway. \"Uhh‚Ä¶\" David sighed. \"Alright, on three. One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ three!\" They both shoved Eli forward, his massive belly squeezing through the frame. SCRRRTCH! POP! Eli toppled inside with a loud THUD.

Go get some sleep.\" The waiter managed a tired smile. \"Goodnight.\" He turned and staggered down the hall.

His eyes darted around the room, scanning the faces of the staff. \"Looking for someone?\" David asked casually. Eli shrugged, trying to sound indifferent. \"Just‚Ä¶ wondering if that waiter from last night works here too.\" David smirked. \"Aw, missing your personal food delivery guy already?\" Eli rolled his eyes but didn‚Äôt deny it. \"Whatever.

I‚Äôm like a balloon right now!\" Thankfully, the pool wasn‚Äôt too crowded, and the space was big enough for them to move without too many eyes on them. David scanned the area and spotted the large, elevated hot tub nestled in a corner, steam rising invitingly. \"There. That should help,\" David pointed. But as they approached, two problems became clear. First‚Äîthe hot tub was raised, requiring them to climb a set of three small steps. Second‚Äîthere was already someone in the hot tub. A heavier man lounged in the bubbling water, eyes closed and completely relaxed. Neither David nor Eli noticed him. David leaned in, lowering his voice. \"Okay, we need to be quick. No one‚Äôs looking. You need to get up those steps.\" Eli stared at the steps and then at his belly, which was too wide and heavy to move easily. \"Uh, David? Not happening.\" David groaned. \"Just grab the railing, and I‚Äôll push.\" Eli sighed but reached for the metal handrail. David braced himself behind Eli, shoving with both hands under Eli's belly as Eli strained to pull himself up. \"Come on‚Ä¶ just a little‚Äî\" With a wet, squelching sound, Eli‚Äôs enormous gut finally flopped out of the pool, smacking heavily onto the edge. Water splashed everywhere. David gave one final shove, and Eli managed to drag himself up the steps. Then, with a strained grunt, Eli heaved himself over the rim of the hot tub. KA-WHOOSH! An enormous wave of hot water erupted as Eli‚Äôs massive belly crashed into the bubbling water, sending a tidal wave over the edge. The blast of water hit the lounging man full force, launching him out of the hot tub with a startled yelp. ‚ÄúWHOA!‚Äù The man tumbled backward onto the pool deck, sputtering and soaked. Eli, oblivious, sighed contently as he settled into the now half-empty tub. His gigantic belly took up nearly all the space, wobbling and floating lazily in the remaining water. David climbed in beside him, carefully squeezing into what little space was left. \"Well‚Ä¶ he needed to leave anyway.\" Eli closed his eyes, relaxing. \"Mmm‚Ä¶ this feels so much better.\" For a few peaceful moments, the warm, bubbling water surrounded them. The heat seemed to soothe Eli‚Äôs overstuffed stomach. But then‚Ä¶ something shifted. Blorp. Eli‚Äôs eyes fluttered open. \"Uh‚Ä¶ David?\" David glanced at him. \"What now?\" Eli's belly gave another strange blorp and began to slowly expand, the surface wobbling unnaturally. The bubbling water churned more violently around him. David‚Äôs face paled. \"Oh no.\" The hot water seemed to be triggering something. Eli's belly began to rise higher, swelling larger with slow, ominous groans. Gllllrrrbbb‚Ä¶ \"I think‚Ä¶ I think the water‚Äôs making it worse!\" Eli yelped, gripping the sides of the tub as his stomach stretched tighter. David scrambled back, eyes wide. \"Okay, okay! Out! Get out now!\" Eli tried to move, but his belly was now pressing against the sides of the tub, wedged tightly. The bubbling jets only seemed to make it worse, gurgling and inflating him more. \"I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt move!\" Eli panicked. David frantically looked around. \"Okay, you have to deflate! Now!\" Eli groaned, face red with effort. \"Ugh‚Ä¶ I hate this!\" With a loud, echoing FFFFWOOOOOMP, Eli's belly started to shrink, sloshing and gurgling as it deflated. Water rushed back into the tub, splashing over the sides as the tension in his stomach slowly eased. Panting, Eli slumped back into the water. \"I‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm good now.\" David wiped water off his face. \"Next time, we‚Äôre skipping the hot tub and going straight to the buffet.\" Eli, despite everything, grinned. \"Buffet sounds amazing right now!\" David groaned, dragging a hand down his face. \"Of course it does. Or we could try something else, which doesn't include food!

There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre getting you out of here without drawing attention.\" Eli pouted, giving his massive belly a gentle pat. \"But I don‚Äôt want to! It took so much effort to get this full!\" David narrowed his eyes. \"Eli.\" Eli sighed dramatically. \"Fiiine. But only if we go to another buffet after this!\" David smirked. \"Deal.\" Reluctantly, Eli closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His stomach gave a deep, echoing grooooan before slowly starting to shrink. Blorp... Gllllrrrp... Little by little, the massive, stretched dome of his belly softened and deflated, the tension easing away. The water around them calmed as Eli‚Äôs body returned to its usual slim frame. Eli slumped forward, panting. \"Ugh‚Ä¶ I hate doing that.\" David chuckled. \"Yeah, well, at least now you can fit through doors again.\" They climbed out of the pool and headed back to their cabin to change. Inside the cozy room, Eli flopped onto the bed, towel draped over his shoulders. His eyes drifted to the ceiling, and he muttered, \"I wonder how much food they actually have on this ship‚Ä¶\" David froze mid-step, staring at him. \"Eli.\" Eli sat up, thoughtful. \"No, seriously! I mean, it‚Äôs a huge cruise. Thousands of people. There must be literal tons of food somewhere!\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"This cruise is three weeks long. Three. Weeks. You don‚Äôt have to eat it all in the first two days.\" Eli grinned. \"I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôd be a shame to let it go to waste.\" David rolled his eyes. \"You are not eating the entire ship.\" Eli chuckled but then perked up. \"Sooo‚Ä¶ what now? Buffet round two? Or maybe the cinema? I heard they‚Äôre playing some good movies.\" David paused, considering it. \"Do you actually want to watch a movie this time, or are you just thinking about the snacks?\" Eli grinned. \"Can‚Äôt it be both?\" David sighed, shaking his head with a smirk. \"Alright, your choice.

David sipped his coffee, watching him with an amused smirk. ‚ÄúSo, are you going to stay here all day, or should we actually do something besides eating?‚Äù David asked. Eli paused, tapping his fork against his plate. \"Hmm... I guess we could go soak up some sun.\" David raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"Really?\" \"But,\" Eli added, holding up a finger, \"I need to eat something first. I mean, come on, I've only had a measly four trays so far!\" David sighed. \"Of course.\" Without wasting time, Eli grabbed two more trays and piled them high with pancakes, bacon, pastries, and fruit. He devoured them with ease, his belly starting to swell and round out, pushing against the edge of the table. By the time Eli was done, his stomach was noticeably bloated, stretching his shirt tight. He groaned contently, leaning back and rubbing his taut belly. \"Okay, now I‚Äôm ready.\" David rolled his eyes but stood up. \"Let‚Äôs go before you change your mind.\"They made their way to the elevator, Eli waddling slightly as his bloated belly swayed with every step. David pressed the button, and the doors slid open. They rode up to the top deck in silence, the gentle hum of the elevator broken only by Eli‚Äôs soft groans of fullness. When they stepped out onto the upper deck, a pleasant breeze greeted them. The morning sun was already warming the air, casting a golden glow over the vast, open ocean. Eli squinted behind his sunglasses, scanning the rows of lounge chairs. His eyes locked onto an extra-wide lounger, clearly designed for heavier passengers. \"Perfect,\" Eli muttered with a grin. He waddled over and flopped onto the oversized chair with a deep oof, causing it to creak under his weight. He adjusted himself, pulling his sunglasses into place and plopping a floppy sunhat on his head. David chuckled. \"Comfortable?\" Eli let out a long sigh. \"Very.\" David glanced at the railing overlooking the ocean. \"You don‚Äôt want to take a walk? Enjoy the view?\" Eli barely turned his head. \"It‚Äôs just water. Looks the same from here.\" David shook his head. \"Fine, I‚Äôll go take a look.\"David strolled along the deck, enjoying the cool breeze and the endless expanse of the ocean. The sun glinted off the waves, and for a brief moment, he appreciated the peace. But when he returned to Eli, he stopped in his tracks. Eli hadn't moved‚Äîbut now, beside his lounger was a small table stacked with three colorful cocktails, condensation dripping down the glasses. Resting on his massive belly was a tray piled high with snacks. David blinked. \"Seriously?\" Eli lazily turned his head. \"What? A waiter came by. What was I supposed to do‚Äînot order something?\" David rubbed his face. \"You were supposed to relax.\" Eli smirked and casually raised a hand, signaling to the waiter across the deck. The waiter gave a polite nod and hurried off. David sighed but said nothing, flopping down onto the lounger next to him. His muscles still ached from the gym, and the warmth of the sun lulled him into a slow, steady sleep.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^David wakes-up to huge Eli",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^David wakes-up but Eli is gone",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLeanedBackInT8.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theWarmSunBathed"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLeanedBackInT9":[["^Eli leaned back in the booth, already working through his second plate of breakfast.

Go lift something heavy. I‚Äôll be right here.\" David rolled his eyes, grabbed his room key, and headed out.After a quick change in their cabin, David found himself in one of the ship‚Äôs luxurious fitness centers. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a breathtaking view of the endless ocean. The gym was sleek and modern, filled with the quiet hum of treadmills and the soft clang of weights. David got to work, pushing himself hard for a solid hour. Sweat dripped down his face as he powered through sets, muscles burning. By the time he was finished, he felt completely spent but satisfied. After a refreshing shower, David threw on clean clothes and made his way back to the buffet.As David approached the booth where he had left Eli, he frowned. It was empty. \"Huh.\" David glanced around. Maybe he went back to the cabin? But then‚ÄîTHWUMP. THWUMP. A deep, echoing sound caught David's attention, followed by loud, high-pitched laughter. He knew that sound all too well. David followed the noise around the corner, and what he saw made him stop dead in his tracks. Eli was wedged into a larger booth, his belly massively swollen again, stretched so tight it pushed against the edge of the table. On either side of him sat two young waitresses, both laughing hysterically as they shoved stacks of powdered donuts into Eli‚Äôs mouth. One of them leaned in, giggling, \"Come on, open up! There‚Äôs still more!\" Eli obediently opened wide, cheeks bulging as another donut disappeared. His bloated stomach gave a deep, satisfied groan, and he instinctively patted it with both hands, causing a deep THWUMP that echoed off the walls. The girls cackled even harder, practically falling over each other. David stared, blinking slowly. \"Oh, for God's sake.\" Eli glanced up, locking eyes with David. His expression was pure guilt, his eyes wide and desperate as if saying, I swear, this isn‚Äôt my fault! David raised an eyebrow. The two waitresses finally noticed David standing there. One of them gave him an obvious once-over, smirking. \"Oh wow, look at you! Someone‚Äôs been using the gym.\" The other giggled. \"You should‚Äôve joined us! We were just having a little fun!\" David gave them a flat look. \"Yeah, I can see that.\" One of the girls patted Eli‚Äôs massive belly affectionately. \"Sadly, we have to get back to work.\" She winked at Eli. \"Try not to pop, okay?\" The other leaned in closer. \"Come find us later if you want more‚Ä¶\" With that, both waitresses giggled and waved as they sauntered off, leaving Eli slouched in the booth, belly heaving with each breath. David slowly turned back to Eli, crossing his arms. \"So‚Ä¶ care to explain?\" Eli groaned, giving his belly a weak pat. \"I didn‚Äôt do anything! They just‚Ä¶ came over, started touching my belly, and next thing I knew, they were feeding me trays of donuts!\" David stared for a long moment before sighing. \"Of course they did.\" Eli gave a sheepish grin. \"I couldn‚Äôt exactly stop them, could I?\" David pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You‚Äôre impossible.\" He glanced at the clock on the wall. \"So‚Ä¶ you want to go catch some sun on the upper deck, or do you have more accidents planned?\" Eli rubbed his enormous belly thoughtfully. \"Hmm‚Ä¶ the sun does sound nice, but the buffet isn‚Äôt going to eat itself.\" David smirked. \"Pick one.

Eli was still on his oversized lounger‚Äîbut now his belly had ballooned into a massive, round dome, wobbling slightly with every breath. His bloated gut stretched so wide it spilled over the sides of the lounger, his shirt long since ridden up to expose the taut, shiny skin of his stomach. Empty cocktail glasses were piled high on the small table next to him, and Eli was holding another colorful drink in one hand while lazily stuffing pastries into his mouth with the other. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes glassy. David‚Äôs eyes narrowed. \"Oh no.\" Eli took a long, sloppy sip of his drink and waved the empty glass in the air. \"Hey! More!\" he slurred, pointing at a nearby waiter. \"Faster! And bring me‚Äîhic‚Äîeverything!\" The young waiter, looking nervous, quickly turned to fetch more. Around them, other guests lounging nearby began to whisper and stare. \"Is he still eating?\" \"How is that even possible?\" \"Doesn‚Äôt he ever stop?\" A grumpy man sitting a few chairs away muttered loudly, \"At this rate, that pig's gonna eat the whole buffet! What are we supposed to eat?\" Eli‚Äôs half-lidded eyes snapped in his direction. He slowly turned his head, glaring. \"Be glad I don‚Äôt eat you, buddy,\" Eli growled darkly, his voice low and rumbling. The man paled and looked away, muttering under his breath. David finally sat up, running a hand over his face. \"Eli, seriously?\" But Eli didn‚Äôt respond. He was too busy guzzling another drink, the liquid spilling slightly down his chin. His free hand was already reaching for another tray of food. Then‚Äî CRACK. David‚Äôs head shot up. \"Oh no.\" CRRRRACK‚Äî With a sharp SNAP, the frame of Eli‚Äôs oversized lounger gave way under the immense weight. CRASH! Eli let out a surprised grunt as the chair collapsed beneath him, sending him tumbling onto the deck in a heap of wobbling belly and limbs. His enormous stomach jiggled violently from the impact. For a moment, there was silence. Then the deck erupted in laughter. Guests around them burst into loud, mocking laughter, some pointing, others openly giggling. One man snorted, \"Guess they need industrial strength furniture for him!\" David grimaced. Eli, still sprawled out on the deck, turned beet red. His fists clenched at his sides, and his bloated belly heaved with every furious breath. His eyes darted around the laughing crowd, seething. He shakily pointed a finger at them, his hand trembling with anger. \"You‚Äôll all regret this,\" he snarled through gritted teeth. The laughter only grew louder. Without another word, Eli struggled to his feet, gripping the nearby railing for support. His enormous belly swayed heavily as he stomped toward the elevator. David jumped up. \"Eli, wait‚Äî!\" But Eli didn‚Äôt stop. He slammed the elevator button with his fist, and when the doors opened, he squeezed his massive body inside, glaring at anyone who looked his way. The doors closed with a soft ding, and Eli was gone. David cursed under his breath. \"Damn it.\" Not wasting another second, he bolted for the next elevator, jamming the button repeatedly. \"Come on, come on!\" As soon as the doors opened, David rushed inside, hitting the button for the lower deck. \"What the hell is he up to now?\" David muttered, staring at the elevator doors as they slid shut.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli gets furious",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Eli just goes to calm down nerves",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliStormedThroug"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theSunWasAlready.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theWarmSunBathed":[["^The warm sun bathed the upper deck as David slowly stirred awake.

David sat up, frowning. The small table next to Eli‚Äôs lounger was piled high with empty cocktail glasses, their colorful straws sticking out at odd angles, and a mountain of empty snack plates. David sighed, rubbing his face. \"Of course.\" He stood up and scanned the deck, but Eli was nowhere in sight. David spotted a nearby waiter wiping down a table and approached him. ‚ÄúHey, did you see where my friend went? The guy who was here‚Äîkinda hard to miss, big appetite?‚Äù The waiter chuckled knowingly. ‚ÄúOh, yeah. I saw him take the elevator down about twenty minutes ago.‚Äù David raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDid he say where he was going?‚Äù The waiter tapped his chin. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I think right before that, they made an announcement about a magic show happening in one of the theaters.

Thanks.‚Äù Without another word, he made his way toward the elevators.The theater was buzzing with excitement. The large hall was packed, mostly with families and excited kids eagerly waiting for the magic show to begin. The lights dimmed, and soft music played over the speakers. David slipped into the back, scanning the crowd. No sign of Eli. He carefully moved down the aisle, glancing between the rows. Still nothing. But then‚Äîout of the corner of his eye‚Äîhe caught a glimpse. Near the side of the stage, Eli was trying to slip behind a curtain, disappearing into the backstage area. David narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, for the love of‚Äî\" He started moving toward the side entrance, but suddenly, the lights in the theater went out completely. DUN DUN DUNNNN! Dramatic music filled the room, and a spotlight snapped onto the stage. The magician, dressed in a shimmering black suit with a tall hat, raised his hands high. ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, prepare yourselves for a feat beyond imagination! I will now make my two assistants... disappear!‚Äù The crowd cheered. David groaned and sank into an empty seat. \"Here we go.\" On stage, two smiling assistants‚Äîa man and a woman‚Äîstepped into a large, ornate wooden cabinet. The magician closed the doors with a theatrical flourish and began spinning the cabinet slowly, showing it off from all angles. He circled the box dramatically, waving his hands and muttering in exaggerated tones. Then‚Äî GLLLUUUUURP. A deep, muffled swallowing sound echoed faintly through the stage speakers. The magician paused for half a second, blinking in confusion. David, sitting in the darkened theater, smirked to himself. \"Yep.\" But the magician quickly regained his composure, pretending it was all part of the act. With a final wave of his hands, he flung the cabinet doors open. Empty. The crowd erupted into applause and cheers, children squealing with excitement. The magician bowed deeply, hiding his brief look of confusion. Backstage, in the shadows beneath the stage, Eli quietly emerged from behind a curtain. His shirt was strained to its limit, stretched tightly over his now massively bloated belly, which shifted and wobbled with every step. He clutched his enormous gut, moving carefully through the darkness, the sounds of faint muffled protests coming from deep within. David, watching from the back, stood up and smirked, shaking his head.David quietly followed Eli through the dimly lit hallway behind the theater, watching him waddle ahead with his enormous, gurgling belly shifting with every step. The muffled sounds of movement and faint protests came from deep inside Eli's stomach, making it wobble slightly. David shook his head in disbelief. \"Eli, seriously?\" Eli glanced over his shoulder, giving David a sheepish grin. He patted his massive, round gut with both hands, making it jiggle. \"What? They were supposed to disappear, right? So technically... nothing happened!\" David stopped in his tracks, staring at him. \"You ate the magician's assistants!\" Eli waved a hand dismissively. \"Pfft, it‚Äôs called method acting, David.

The metal walls creaked slightly as he leaned against them.\"Stupid tiny elevators,\" he muttered.The doors finally slid open on the sun deck, and Eli waddled out into the bright, warm sunlight.

His skin, now an angry shade of red, glistened under the sunlight as Eli melted into the lounge chair.\"Mmm... better,\" Eli sighed, closing his eyes in relief. \"But I think I deserve something for all this suffering.\"David shot him a flat look. \"You‚Äôre lucky we didn‚Äôt have to call the ship's medic.\"Eli smirked, giving his enormous belly a slow, content pat. \"Yeah, yeah‚Ä¶ but what now?\"David raised an eyebrow, wiping his hands on a towel. \"Well, what do you want to do?\"Eli grinned lazily, his eyes glinting behind his sunglasses.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for lunch",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Go to the cabin to \"relax\"",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliShotHimALazyG.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theElevatorDoors1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLoungedInHisB":[["^Eli lounged in his booth, lazily devouring stacks of pancakes and bacon, his belly already swollen from the waitresses' earlier pampering. His gut pressed heavily against the table, rising and falling with each slow, satisfied breath. Then the air seemed to shift. The buffet doors slammed open with a thunderous BANG. In stomped a mountain of a man. Easily over 500 pounds, his bulk strained every inch of his too-tight clothing. His stretched-out t-shirt clung to his massive, sweat-slicked chest, barely covering his enormous, pale gut that hung far over the waistband of his pants. Thick suspenders strained to hold up his sagging, overfilled trousers. His meaty fists clenched and unclenched as his small, predatory eyes locked onto the buffet. Without a word, he stomped forward, each step causing his belly to quake and jiggle heavily. \"Move!\" he barked at a waiter who scrambled out of his way. The man seized a tray in his thick hands and began piling it high‚Äîplates of greasy sausages, mountains of scrambled eggs, pancakes drowned in syrup, and slabs of dripping meat. Food teetered dangerously on the edge of the tray, but he didn't care. He dropped into the booth directly beside Eli with a heavy, chair-creaking THUMP. Without so much as a glance, he leaned in and began devouring everything in front of him. He didn‚Äôt use utensils. Forks and knives were too slow. He clawed at the food with thick, sausage-like fingers, stuffing handfuls of greasy bacon and syrup-soaked pancakes into his mouth. Bits of food sprayed from his lips as he barely chewed, swallowing in loud, wet gulps. GLRK. GLRK. His throat worked overtime, forcing food down as grease dripped from his chin onto the table. Eli watched him from the corner of his eye. The man paused for a moment, noticing Eli‚Äôs swollen belly. He slowly turned his head, eyes narrowing. Their eyes locked. A brief, tense silence. Then the man smirked, letting out a low, guttural chuckle. Without breaking eye contact, he raised a fist and snapped his fingers. \"MORE!\" he growled. \"Keep it coming!\" A waiter hurried off in a panic. Eli‚Äôs eyes darkened. His smirk slowly spread across his face. Challenge accepted. Without a word, Eli rose from his seat, his own bloated belly wobbling with each step. He grabbed two trays and loaded them higher than before‚Äîevery kind of food he could find. He sauntered back to his booth, passing so close to the man that his belly nearly brushed against the other‚Äôs table. The man‚Äôs smirk faded slightly. Eli sat down, leaned in, and began to devour.For the next hour, the two titans ate with terrifying determination. Plates shattered. Food vanished. The buffet staff worked in a panic to refill the serving stations as fast as possible. Eli‚Äôs belly grew rapidly, swelling larger with every bite. It ballooned outward, pushing against the table and slowly spreading onto the floor. The tight fabric of his shirt creaked ominously, struggling to contain the sheer mass of his stomach. But the other man wasn‚Äôt far behind. His belly expanded grotesquely, rounding out so far it pinned him between the booth and the table. His suspenders strained, biting into his thick shoulders. His face dripped with sweat, but he kept going, grabbing fistfuls of mashed food and cramming it into his mouth. GLRK. GLRK. The wet, choking gulps echoed louder now. His face turned redder, his breathing heavier. But he refused to stop. The buffet had fallen silent. Guests stared in shock, unable to look away. The man‚Äôs pace began to falter. His hands, once ravenous and wild, now trembled as he grabbed another greasy sausage. His massive gut gurgled loudly, sending deep, unsettling sounds through the air. GROOOOOOOAN. But still, he pushed on, stuffing a disgusting, half-mashed mix of food into his mouth with trembling fingers. The food barely fit. His throat struggled to swallow. GLK‚Ä¶ gghk‚Ä¶ GLK. His eyes began to glaze over. His stomach lurched and shifted beneath his tight shirt, stretched so thin it looked ready to burst. Eli, still eating steadily, leaned back, his own enormous belly rising triumphantly in front of him. He casually lifted a buttery croissant and took a slow, exaggerated bite, locking eyes with his opponent. The man froze, his entire body trembling. He let out a choked grunt, and his fat hands dropped the remaining food onto his plate. His bloated stomach let out a deep, angry GRRROOOAAAN in protest. \"Ngh...\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Fat man accepts defeat",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Fat man's greed",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.eliLoungedInHisB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.eliLoungedBackIn"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliStormedThroug":[["^Eli stormed through the ship's corridors, fists clenched, his face still burning with humiliation.

David walked slowly beside Eli, his eyes glued to the enormous, rounded belly swaying with each step Eli took. Eli‚Äôs hoodie clung to his sides, riding up slightly to reveal the stretched, smooth skin of his stomach. But what held David‚Äôs attention wasn‚Äôt just Eli‚Äôs size‚Äîit was the subtle, almost imperceptible movements beneath the surface. The two magician‚Äôs assistants Eli had swallowed earlier shifted faintly inside him, causing small ripples to travel across his belly. David swallowed hard, his hands unconsciously reaching out to press gently against the side of Eli‚Äôs belly. Eli glanced sideways, smirking. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt keep your hands off me, huh?‚Äù David chuckled breathlessly, fingers tracing slow circles over Eli‚Äôs taut skin. ‚ÄúHow could I? You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ incredible.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs belly gave a soft, low gurgle, followed by another faint shift inside. David felt the motion under his palms and shivered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still moving.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs smirk deepened. ‚ÄúGuess they‚Äôre still trying to figure out the trick.‚Äù David bit his lip, his breath quickening. The heat pooling in his chest was impossible to ignore. ‚ÄúWe need to‚Ä¶ do something about this,‚Äù David muttered, his voice rougher than he intended. Eli raised a brow, amused. ‚ÄúYeah? What did you have in mind?‚Äù David grabbed Eli‚Äôs wrist, pulling him gently but firmly. ‚ÄúCabin. Now.‚Äù Eli chuckled low in his throat. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ask.‚Äù They shuffled quickly down the corridor, Eli‚Äôs massive belly swaying with every step, soft creaks of the floor echoing beneath their feet. Once inside the cabin, David didn‚Äôt waste time. He pushed the door shut and turned to face Eli, eyes dark with need. ‚ÄúBed. Now.‚Äù Eli laughed, allowing David to guide him backward until the backs of his knees hit the mattress. He let himself fall heavily onto the bed, belly rising like a taut mountain between them. David knelt beside him, hands roaming hungrily over Eli‚Äôs stretched skin. The faint movements beneath made his breath catch‚Äîanother subtle shift, a soft groan from deep inside Eli‚Äôs stomach. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still squirming in there,‚Äù David whispered, voice trembling. Eli hummed, patting his belly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going anywhere.‚Äù David leaned down, placing slow, deliberate kisses along the tight curve of Eli‚Äôs belly. Eli groaned softly, arching into the touch. David‚Äôs hands slid lower, hooking into the waistband of Eli‚Äôs strained shorts. He tugged them down slowly, exposing the soft curve of Eli‚Äôs hips and the tight bulge in his boxers. ‚ÄúLet me help you with this,‚Äù David murmured, dragging Eli‚Äôs boxers down. Eli‚Äôs breath hitched as David leaned in, taking him fully into his mouth. Slowly. Thoroughly. Eli groaned louder, hands gripping the sheets as David worked him over, not stopping until Eli trembled beneath him. David swallowed everything without hesitation, pulling back only when Eli‚Äôs breath evened out. But David wasn‚Äôt finished. He stood briefly, pushing his own shorts down, freeing himself. He climbed over Eli, gripping Eli‚Äôs massive belly for balance. Eli watched him with heavy-lidded eyes, smirking lazily. ‚ÄúStill hungry?‚Äù David didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he pressed himself against Eli‚Äôs belly, grinding slowly as heat built between them. Eli‚Äôs belly shifted again, faintly, reminding them both of what still lingered inside. The feeling only pushed David further. His body tensed, and he let go, spilling across Eli‚Äôs swollen belly, groaning as he collapsed beside him. They lay together, panting softly, the cabin filled with the scent of sweat and satisfaction. David ran his hand slowly over Eli‚Äôs belly, smearing the mess across his skin. Eli chuckled lowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just as messy as I am.‚Äù David laughed softly, resting his head on Eli‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWorth it.‚Äù A long silence stretched between them before David spoke again. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ drinks at the club later?

His massive belly jutted out in front of him, still wobbling slightly from the humiliating fall he‚Äôd just endured on the sun deck. They laughed at me. The memory of the mocking laughter, the stares, and the sound of the sun chair snapping beneath him burned in his mind. They think it‚Äôs funny? They think I‚Äôm funny? His face twisted in anger, and his chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. Then‚Äî GRRRROOOOWWWL. His stomach let out a deep, angry growl, vibrating through the small elevator. Eli blinked, looking down at his belly. \"Oh, great,\" he muttered. \"Now I‚Äôm starving too.\" For a moment, his mind swirled with thoughts of revenge. Maybe he could show them not to laugh at him. Maybe he could... But then another deep gurgle shook his gut, demanding his attention. He sighed, rolling his eyes. \"Forget it. Food first. They‚Äôre not worth it.\" A wicked smirk crept across his face. \"But lunch definitely is.\" The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. Eli waddled forward, his bloated belly swaying heavily with each step as he followed the familiar scent of food. Moments later, Eli shoved open the doors to the Seabreeze Feast Hall. It was quieter than the other buffets, tucked away at the far end of the ship, with panoramic windows showcasing the endless ocean. Elegant displays of food stretched across the room, untouched and perfectly arranged. Eli‚Äôs eyes glinted with excitement. \"Oh yeah‚Ä¶ this‚Äôll do.\" He grabbed two trays and wasted no time stacking them high‚Äîmountains of roasted meats, creamy pastas, buttery rolls, and rich desserts. Plates teetered dangerously as he carried the overloaded trays to a booth. He slumped down with a heavy WHUMP, the booth creaking under his weight, and immediately began devouring everything in sight. GLRK. MMFF. GULP. His belly groaned loudly as it swelled larger, pushing against the edge of the table. Meanwhile, David was pacing the ship, frustration mounting. \"Where the hell did he go?\" David muttered under his breath, checking his phone for the tenth time. Eli still wasn‚Äôt answering. David scowled. \"Fine. I‚Äôll check every damn buffet on this ship if I have to.\" He stomped off, determination in his stride. Back in the buffet, Eli was lost in his feast when a light tap landed on his shoulder. \"Huh?\" Eli turned, ready to snap, but stopped. Standing there was Ryan‚Äîthe young waiter from the previous day. \"Hey!\" Eli‚Äôs face lit up. \"Didn‚Äôt expect to see you again.\" Ryan chuckled nervously, glancing at the towering plates of food. \"Yeah, hard to miss you.\" Eli leaned back, giving his belly a proud pat. \"You should‚Äôve seen the way they treated me on the sun deck. Laughing at me like a bunch of idiots.\" Ryan‚Äôs expression darkened. \"That‚Äôs awful. People can be so cruel.\" Eli grumbled, grabbing another fistful of food. \"Tell me about it.\" Ryan hesitated for a second, then his lips curled into a shy smile. \"You know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm off today, but if you want, I could help you out again. Bring you whatever you need.\" Eli blinked, then grinned widely. \"Seriously?\" \"Seriously,\" Ryan nodded. \"Anything you want.\" \"Man, you‚Äôre the best,\" Eli chuckled. \"Let‚Äôs do it.\" Ryan rushed off, returning moments later with towering trays of food. This time, he didn‚Äôt even bother setting them down. \"Open up,\" Ryan grinned. Eli smirked and obeyed. Ryan eagerly began feeding Eli directly‚Äîshoving in mouthfuls of food, barely giving him time to swallow. At one point, Eli leaned forward and swallowed an entire plate along with the food, the crunch of ceramic audible. Ryan froze for a moment, eyes wide, then let out a soft, breathless laugh. \"That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs insane.\" Eli licked his lips. \"Keep it coming.\"David stormed through hallway after hallway, buffet after buffet, but no Eli. His frustration deepened until he turned into a quiet corridor‚Äîand stopped. On the wall ahead, framed under glass, were missing person posters. David‚Äôs blood ran cold. Pictures of smiling passengers, each with the word MISSING in bold letters. David‚Äôs eyes scanned the faces‚Äîand his stomach dropped. The couple from the water slides. The magician‚Äôs assistants. Random guests he barely noticed before. All people Eli had casually eaten. David's hands clenched at his sides. \"Oh no...\" He didn‚Äôt waste another second.David burst into the Seabreeze Feast Hall, his eyes scanning the room. And there‚Äîsprawled out in a booth, his belly now enormous‚Äîwas Eli. Ryan stood beside him, gleefully stuffing more food into Eli‚Äôs mouth. David froze, wide-eyed. \"*Oh, come on!\" Eli spotted him and lazily lifted a sticky hand. \"Hey, David!\" David stormed over, eyes flicking between Eli and Ryan. \"Are you kidding me?!\" \"Relax,\" Eli chuckled. \"Ryan‚Äôs just helping out.\" Ryan grinned sheepishly. \"Hey.\" David leaned in, lowering his voice. \"I just saw a wall of missing passengers. All people you‚Äôve... eaten.\" Eli smirked. \"No one‚Äôs connecting that to me.\" David‚Äôs eyes narrowed. \"I‚Äôm not so sure. We need to go.

The air was thick with the rich aroma of roasted meats, fresh bread, and sweet desserts. In the center of it all, Eli and David stepped into the vibrant Golden Horizon Buffet, a massive dining area adorned with elegant food displays. Eli‚Äôs eyes immediately locked onto a large, elaborate carving table near the entrance. Stunning sculptures made from watermelons, pumpkins, pineapples, and various other fruits and vegetables stood proudly on display. There were intricately carved flowers, animals, and even a miniature ship made entirely out of melon rinds and carved squash. \"Whoa,\" Eli breathed, practically drooling. David followed his gaze and smirked. \"Don‚Äôt even think about it. That‚Äôs decorative.\" Eli pouted, tearing his eyes away. \"Yeah, yeah‚Ä¶\" His stomach let out a low groooowl of protest. \"Fine.\" They made their way to the main food stations, and Eli wasted no time piling his tray high with every dish he could reach. He practically inhaled plate after plate of rich meats, pasta, and buttery sides, his belly swelling steadily. But as he ate, his eyes kept flicking back to the carving table. He licked his lips absentmindedly. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed something even more tempting‚Äîa second carving station on the other side of the buffet. This one wasn‚Äôt decorative. It was piled high with freshly roasted meats: a whole roasted pig, glazed ham on the bone, and thick cuts of smoked brisket. Eli‚Äôs pupils dilated. \"Stay calm,\" he whispered to himself, shoveling more food into his mouth. \"Stay focused.\" But the temptation gnawed at him. His stomach gave a deep, eager gurgle. \"Be right back,\" David said suddenly, standing up. \"Gonna hit the restroom. Try not to eat the table.\" \"No promises,\" Eli muttered, eyes still locked on the fruit sculptures. As soon as David disappeared into the crowd, Eli slowly pushed himself up, his bloated belly wobbling. He waddled toward the carving table, licking his lips. An elderly woman was standing nearby, admiring the delicate fruit sculptures. \"*Oh, aren‚Äôt these just lovely?\" she cooed. \"Must have taken hours to make!\" Eli stood beside her, breathing heavily, his eyes fixed on a giant watermelon carved into a blooming flower. His stomach growled loudly. The woman glanced at him with a polite smile. \"Oh, dear, are you hungry? You know, this isn‚Äôt for‚Äî\" GULP. Eli leaned forward and, without hesitation, grabbed the watermelon with both hands and shoved it into his mouth. His throat bulged grotesquely as the entire fruit slid down in one monstrous swallow. The woman gasped, clutching her pearls. \"Oh my heavens!\" But Eli didn‚Äôt stop. His eyes glazed over as he grabbed a towering pineapple sculpture and gulped it down, followed by an intricately carved pumpkin. \"No! That‚Äôs not for‚Äî!\" the woman shrieked, backing away in shock. Eli groaned in pleasure, hands moving faster. One by one, he devoured every single decorative piece‚Äîmelons, gourds, pineapples, and even the squash carved into tiny flowers. Within moments, the entire display was gone. The woman stood frozen, staring in horror at the empty table. Eli wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Beautiful,\" he muttered, patting his now even larger belly. But he wasn‚Äôt done. He turned and waddled over to the other carving station. The carving chef barely had time to react before Eli lunged forward. \"Hey! Sir, please‚Äî!\" GULP. The entire glazed ham vanished into Eli‚Äôs mouth with a sickening slurp. GULP. The roasted pig followed, its crisped skin cracking as it slid down his throat. \"Oh my god!\" someone shouted. Eli leaned over and grabbed two massive turkey legs, crunching them bones and all. The carving chef stood paralyzed, knife dangling in his hand. Satisfied, Eli let out a heavy sigh, rubbing his belly that now sagged low, dragging against his knees. \"Perfect,\" he mumbled and waddled back to his booth just as David returned, wiping his hands on a napkin. \"What did I miss?\" David asked casually. Eli grinned, reclining in the booth and giving his massive belly a proud pat. \"Oh, nothing. Just enjoying lunch.\" But David paused, his eyes narrowing. Something felt‚Ä¶ off. He glanced around. The once-grand fruit carving table? Completely empty. Not even a slice of melon remained. The meat carving station? Devastated. No pig. No ham. Just an empty platter and a horrified chef. David slowly turned back to Eli. \"What‚Ä¶ did you do?\" Eli smirked. \"Guess they need better security.\" David rubbed his face in disbelief. \"Unbelievable.\" \"Come on,\" Eli chuckled, stretching with effort. \"Let‚Äôs hit another buffet.

His massive gut wobbled and jiggled as they awkwardly lifted and pulled, chairs scraping against the floor. \"Careful, you idiots!\" the man snapped as they shuffled him toward the exit. As they reached the buffet doors, he turned his head back toward Eli and barked, \"*Enjoy it while it lasts, kid! I‚Äôll be back for lunch!\" Eli chuckled, leaning back and patting his enormous belly. \"I‚Äôll save you a seat.\" The doors swung shut behind the man and his struggling entourage. Eli casually returned to his meal, still picking at what little food remained. Moments later, David entered the buffet, towel draped over his shoulder, looking relaxed and refreshed. He paused near the entrance, watching the massive man and the waiters awkwardly disappear down the hall. David raised an eyebrow. \"Okay‚Ä¶ what did I miss?\" Eli smirked, waving lazily. \"Oh, just another pathetic twig who thought he could take me on.\" David sighed, shaking his head. \"Seriously?\" Eli chuckled, licking his fingers. \"It wasn‚Äôt even close.\" David walked over to Eli‚Äôs booth, eyeing the carnage of empty plates. \"And what about you? You done proving your dominance, or do you want to eat the furniture next?\" Eli grinned, giving his bloated belly a firm pat. \"Eh, I‚Äôm kinda over the breakfast stuff. Maybe another buffet with something new would hit the spot.\" David groaned and rubbed his face. \"I was thinking of something that doesn‚Äôt involve you eating the ship.\" Eli raised a curious brow. \"Like what?\" David leaned in, smirking. \"How about we head back to the cabin for a bit?\" Eli blinked, then grinned slowly. \"Ohhh.\" David chuckled, already turning toward the exit. \"Come on, before you challenge the next guy to a food duel.\" Eli struggled to get up, his belly wobbling. \"Fine, fine‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm picking the next buffet.\" David laughed. \"We‚Äôll see about that.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Go for lunch buffet",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Enjoy some \"fun\" in cabin",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theGrandBuffetHa"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.TheMassiveManSat.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.DavidLedEliDownT"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"eliLoungedBackIn":[["^Eli lounged back in his booth, a smug grin on his face as he slowly chewed a pastry, deliberately savoring every bite. His massive belly loomed in front of him, tight and bloated, yet he still looked relaxed. Across from him, the enormous man sat slumped over his table, drenched in sweat, his face red and glistening. His stomach was grotesquely swollen, pressing hard against the booth, leaving him barely any room to breathe. But then, Eli‚Äôs slow, taunting bite hit a nerve. The man‚Äôs heavy-lidded eyes narrowed. No. I won‚Äôt lose. With a growl deep in his throat, he slammed his thick palms onto the table, causing plates and cutlery to rattle. Gritting his teeth, he reached for the nearest tray and forced more food into his mouth. His massive hands shook as he crammed handfuls of greasy meat and soggy pastries between his lips. But his body was rejecting every bite. His throat struggled to swallow. Each painful gulp sent a visible ripple through his overstuffed gut, which let out deep, ominous gurgling noises. GRRRRRRGLLL... The man grunted, clutching his stomach. His face twisted in pain, but he refused to stop. His suspenders strained dangerously. The metal clips dug into his fat shoulders, barely holding back the tidal wave of his gut. Then‚Äî SNAP! The suspenders shot backward with a violent CRACK, smacking the wall behind him. His enormous belly lurched forward, spilling over his waistband, jiggling heavily. The bloated gut wobbled, and a low, deep creeeeak rumbled from within, like the sound of an overinflated balloon stretching beyond its limit. A nearby waiter cautiously approached, wringing his hands. \"S-sir, maybe you should‚Äî\" \"SHUT UP!\" the man roared, not breaking his glare from Eli. With crazed determination, he grabbed another fistful of food and shoved it into his mouth, stuffing his cheeks so full they bulged unnaturally. He squeezed his eyes shut, trembling violently, and forced the massive, disgusting lump of half-chewed food down his throat with a sickening GLK‚Ä¶ GLRK‚Ä¶ The sound echoed through the silent buffet. Then‚Äînothing. The man froze. His eyes shot wide open. For a split second, the entire room held its breath. And then it happened. CRRRAAAACK! A sickening, wet RIP tore through the air. The man‚Äôs swollen belly burst forward, the waistband of his pants exploding, seams shredding apart. His stomach let out a monstrous GROOOOAAAN as it lurched violently. BLUUUUUURP! The pressure gave way in a horrific, uncontrollable surge. Food, grease, and half-digested slop erupted from him, splattering across the table, the walls‚Äîand Eli. Shrieks filled the buffet as guests scrambled away, overturning chairs and tables. Plates shattered on the floor. Eli sat there, motionless, blinking slowly as chunks of food dripped from his face and shirt. Then he calmly wiped his face with a napkin, chuckling under his breath. \"Guess he couldn‚Äôt handle the heat.\" The buffet was in utter chaos. And then he looked towards the entrance: \"DAVID?!\" Eli glanced up to see David standing at the entrance, frozen in shock. His eyes darted between Eli and the destroyed booth, the collapsed man, and the screaming guests.

David lingered in the doorway, eyes locked on Eli‚Äôs exposed body. ‚ÄúYou going to keep staring, or are you going to help me out of these?‚Äù Eli teased, voice thick with amusement. David swallowed, stepping forward. His fingers found the waistband of Eli‚Äôs strained shorts, tugging them slowly down over Eli‚Äôs thick thighs. The fabric clung tightly before finally slipping free, leaving Eli in nothing but his stretched boxers. David let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs not just your stomach that‚Äôs full,‚Äù David muttered, his hand brushing lower. Eli smirked. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you do something about it?‚Äù David didn‚Äôt need to be told twice. He knelt between Eli‚Äôs legs, pulling down his boxers in one slow motion. Without hesitation, David leaned in, taking Eli fully into his mouth. Eli groaned, his hands instinctively finding David‚Äôs hair as his hips gave a slight thrust. David worked steadily, deep and purposeful, savoring every reaction he pulled from Eli. Eli‚Äôs breath quickened, his stomach quivering slightly with every muffled groan. David didn‚Äôt let up, pushing him closer and closer until Eli‚Äôs body tensed‚Äîthen shuddered. David swallowed without pause, drawing every last bit from him before pulling back slowly, lips slick and breathing hard. Eli collapsed further into the mattress, his chest rising and falling in slow, heavy breaths. David wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his eyes dark with need. But he wasn‚Äôt finished. Without a word, David stood, hooking his thumbs into his own shorts and dragging them down, exposing himself fully. He climbed onto the bed, straddling Eli‚Äôs massive belly.

His breath was ragged, his face red with fury, and his massive hands were still shoveling food into his mouth. Guests backed away in fear and disgust, but then the murmurs turned to angry shouts. \"He‚Äôs dangerous!\" \"He‚Äôs eating everything!\" \"He‚Äôs a monster! Get him out of here!\" David pushed through the crowd, panicked. \"Wait, stop! Don‚Äôt‚Äî!\" But it was too late. A group of furious passengers charged forward, grabbing onto Eli's enormous arms and shoulders. Despite his size, Eli was sluggish and overstuffed, unable to fight back. \"H-hey!\" Eli grunted, struggling. \"Let go of me!\" But the crowd was relentless. \"Out! Get him off the ship!\" someone screamed. Together, they shoved and rolled Eli‚Äôs bloated form toward the enormous open windows that led out to the buffet's terrace. \"Wait! Don‚Äôt do this!\" David pleaded, shoving through the mass of people. \"He didn‚Äôt mean it!\" Eli growled, but his swollen belly made it impossible to stand. \"You‚Äôll all regret this!\" he bellowed, but his voice was drowned by the angry crowd. With one final heave, the mob forced Eli over the edge. THWUMP. Eli's massive body toppled over the railing and plummeted into the ocean below. SPLOOOOOSH! Water erupted into the air as Eli disappeared beneath the waves. David sprinted to the railing, gripping it tightly, his eyes wide with horror. \"ELI!\" He stared at the churning water, but there was nothing‚Äîjust the endless expanse of the sea. \"Eli...\" David‚Äôs voice broke. The crowd slowly dispersed, satisfied and murmuring smugly. \"Good riddance.\" \"Finally, peace and quiet.\" \"Serves him right.\" David slumped onto a lounge chair on the terrace, head in his hands. His chest tightened, and his throat burned. Tears threatened to spill over. But then‚Äî A distant scream echoed from the back of the ship. David‚Äôs head snapped up. More screaming. Louder now. He turned toward the ship's stern, and his blood ran cold. Far behind the ship, the water was moving‚Äîchurning violently. Then something enormous broke the surface. A massive, fleshy pink shape began rising from the waves. It expanded rapidly, swelling larger and larger with every second. David shot to his feet, his heart pounding. \"No way...\" The enormous shape bulged grotesquely, shifting and growing‚Äîuntil David recognized it. It was Eli. But not just Eli. Eli‚Äôs head‚Äîand his mouth, stretched impossibly wide. David watched in stunned horror as Eli inhaled, sucking in massive amounts of seawater. SSSSHHHHHHHHHH! The sound was deafening, like a tidal wave being pulled backward. Waves of water surged into Eli‚Äôs gaping maw, his body swelling to unnatural proportions. His belly ballooned outward, expanding faster than David could comprehend. Crew members and passengers on the upper decks screamed, pointing frantically. \"WHAT IS THAT?!\" \"IT‚ÄôS HIM!\" \"RUN!\" The ship‚Äôs captain, watching the chaos from the bridge, slammed his fist on the controls. \"Full speed ahead! NOW!\" The engines roared, but it was useless. Eli‚Äôs monstrous form continued to swell, his enormous mouth dragging the ship backward. Deck chairs, lifeboats, and even passengers began sliding toward the stern as the ship tilted. David clung to the railing, watching helplessly as Eli grew larger than the ship itself. Then‚Äî Eli‚Äôs eyes narrowed in fury. And he opened his mouth even wider. SSSHHHHHHHHHHH! The suction grew stronger. The ship groaned under the force as the entire vessel began sliding backward. Passengers screamed. Crew members ran. But it was too late. The stern of the ship tilted upward, lifting into the air as Eli‚Äôs enormous, yawning maw consumed it. David could only watch as the sky was replaced by the dark, fleshy walls of Eli's throat. The massive jaws closed slowly around the ship. The world darkened. GULP. A deafening, wet swallow echoed. Everything went still. The ship plunged into darkness, surrounded by the oppressive, slimy walls of Eli‚Äôs stomach. David stumbled, catching himself against a wall. The ship creaked and groaned as it settled into the massive, pulsating chamber. David stared into the suffocating dark. \"Eli...\" And then‚Äîsilence.","\n","^<strong>\"GULP!

His hoodie had been discarded, leaving his bare chest exposed, and his sweatpants strained dangerously against his swollen midsection.

Ryan moved closer, pulling his tie loose with a smirk. ‚ÄúWell, guess I should get comfortable too.‚Äù Without hesitation, Ryan began unbuttoning his shirt, slowly peeling it off before letting it drop to the floor.

His hands eagerly roamed over Eli‚Äôs enormous belly, fingers tracing the stretched skin, massaging the rounded sides. Ryan didn‚Äôt stop there.

He began tossing pieces of fruit and bread into Eli‚Äôs waiting mouth, laughing as Eli chewed and swallowed without pause. Ryan joined in, pushing pieces of cake into Eli‚Äôs mouth while grinding himself harder against Eli‚Äôs belly. Eli‚Äôs belly swelled larger, groaning under the weight of all the food. It spread wider, pushing against the bedposts, forcing the blankets to the floor. The room was thick with heat, sweat, and the scent of food. Then Eli‚Äôs hands moved‚Äîlarge, firm, and purposeful. He reached out, wrapping one hand firmly around David and the other around Ryan. Both men gasped at the sudden contact. Eli‚Äôs grip was steady but unrelenting, stroking them with slow, deliberate motions. David groaned, his hips jerking forward into Eli‚Äôs grasp.

His belly had grown beyond anything imaginable‚Äîan enormous, glistening sphere of stretched skin, bloated to a grotesque size. It wasn‚Äôt just big. It was monumental. His gut rose up in front of him like a swollen dome, towering so high it nearly reached the light fixtures above. It spread outward in every direction, pressing against overturned chairs, pushing aside tables, and sprawling across the floor in a massive, quivering expanse of flesh. The buffet seemed to shrink around him. Entire food stations were hidden behind the mountainous curve of his belly. Guests and staff had long since cleared the area, leaving Eli alone with his feast and his colossal form. His breathing was slow and heavy, each exhale making his belly shift and jiggle slightly. The tight, overworked skin of his stomach groaned under the impossible pressure, creaking and gurgling as it strained to contain the sheer volume of food inside. GRRROOOAAAN. Eli blinked lazily. He felt it. A subtle shift. The ship rocked gently beneath him. At first, it was barely noticeable. His massive belly gave a soft, slow wobble as the floor tilted slightly under the motion of the waves. \"Huh...\" Eli muttered, feeling the strange sensation as his enormous gut subtly shifted, rolling just a fraction from side to side. But then the ship tilted again‚Äîharder this time. His belly lurched, the tremendous mass of it sliding a few inches to the right. \"Oh... oh no.\" The ship rocked again, stronger. His massive stomach shifted more, dragging his entire body along with it. The sheer weight of it was uncontrollable, a living avalanche of flesh. Then the ship dipped sharply. THUMP. Eli‚Äôs gigantic belly rolled hard to the left, pulling him with it. \"Wait‚ÄîWAIT!\" Eli shouted, flailing his arms, but it was useless. THUMP. THUMP. Each tilt of the ship sent his bloated form rolling farther and faster, his massive stomach slamming into tables and chairs, flattening anything in its path. The deep, echoing gurgles inside his stomach grew louder, mingling with the sounds of creaking wood and shattering plates. And then, the ship gave a violent sway. BOOOOM. Eli's gigantic belly lifted and rolled, turning him into a living wrecking ball. His enormous body barreled across the buffet floor, crushing tables, toppling chairs, and sending buffet trays flying. Each tilt of the ship made it worse, sending Eli careening from one end of the buffet to the other, his colossal gut dragging him faster with every shift. The walls groaned under the impacts. His belly, now larger than most of the tables in the room combined, wobbled and swayed with terrifying momentum, slamming into anything in its way. GROOOAAAAAAN. The monstrous, bloated sphere of his stomach shifted and rolled with unstoppable force. The ship groaned in protest.Up in the Bridge, alarms blared.\"Captain!\" a crew member shouted. \"We‚Äôre getting dangerous tilt warnings! Stabilizers are active, but they‚Äôre not compensating!\"The captain narrowed his eyes. \"That‚Äôs impossible.

Crew and passengers alike were thrown off balance.Eli, still rolling helplessly, was now a force of nature.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Stop the rocking",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Capsizing",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theCaptainsFaceD"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.theAfternoonSunB.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theOceanviewBuff"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"sceneOverindulge":[["^Scene ‚Äì Overindulgence in the Cabin The room was heavy with warmth and the scent of food. David and Ryan lay draped over Eli‚Äôs massive form, their breathing slow and steady in the aftermath of their indulgence. Then, without warning, Eli‚Äôs voice shattered the stillness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still starving!‚Äù David jolted upright, blinking in surprise. Ryan sat up, staring wide-eyed at Eli‚Äôs swollen belly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joking,‚Äù David muttered. Eli‚Äôs stomach let out a deep, guttural growl, shaking the bed slightly. Ryan glanced at David and then back to Eli, a grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù Without hesitation, both men scrambled to their feet. Ryan grabbed whatever food was left on the nearby trays while David hurried to the mini-fridge, pulling out anything remotely edible. ‚ÄúOpen wide,‚Äù Ryan teased, stuffing pastries and fruits into Eli‚Äôs waiting mouth. Eli didn‚Äôt need encouragement. He devoured everything eagerly, barely chewing before swallowing. There was a knock at the door. David, breathless, grabbed a towel and hastily wrapped it around his waist. He stumbled to the door and cracked it open. Another cart of food stood in the hallway, steam rising from covered trays. The waiter barely had time to greet him before David cut him off. ‚ÄúPerfect. Just leave it here.‚Äù David dragged the cart into the room, slamming the door behind him. ‚ÄúMore fuel for the fire,‚Äù David laughed, lifting a tray. Ryan joined in, both men feeding Eli relentlessly. Eli‚Äôs belly swelled further, pushing higher into the air, forcing the blankets and pillows off the bed. Wine bottles were passed between them, the alcohol fueling their reckless pace. None of them noticed how Eli‚Äôs stomach began pressing outward, filling the cabin inch by inch. Plates clattered to the floor, forgotten. Eli‚Äôs belly pushed against the walls, the ceiling, slowly devouring the room itself. ‚Äî Outside, another waiter approached the cabin with yet another cart of food. He knocked politely. ‚ÄúRoom service!‚Äù Silence. He knocked again, louder. ‚ÄúRoom service delivery for Cabin 408!‚Äù Still nothing. Frowning, the waiter reached for his master key card and swiped it. The door clicked but opened only a crack. Confused, the waiter leaned in and gave the door a shove. It barely budged, meeting some kind of soft, firm resistance. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶?‚Äù He reached into the gap and his fingers met something warm, smooth, and faintly pulsing. The waiter yelped, jerking his hand back. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù he called out, his voice higher than intended. From within, muffled laughter echoed, followed by Ryan‚Äôs voice, lazy and slurred. ‚ÄúYeah, uh‚Ä¶ just leave it. Something‚Äôs stuck in the door. Don‚Äôt bring any more.‚Äù Then, as if to punctuate the moment, a deep, unsettling GROOOOAN rumbled through the cabin walls. The waiter paled, stepping back, his heart pounding. Without another word, he abandoned the cart and hurried down the hallway. Back inside, Ryan chuckled, tossing another handful of food into Eli‚Äôs mouth. David leaned against the swollen curve of Eli‚Äôs belly, laughing breathlessly. ‚ÄúI think we broke room service.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs belly let out another ominous gurgle. Ryan smirked. ‚ÄúGood. Now, open wide\". Eli let out a satisfied groan, swallowing the last of the food David had managed to shove into his mouth. His massive belly lurched forward, pressing further into the already cramped space. There was a soft, dull thud as Eli‚Äôs bloated stomach surged outward, slamming the slightly ajar cabin door shut with a final, solid click. David burst into laughter, nearly falling back against the wall. Ryan, wedged tightly between Eli‚Äôs head and the curve of his belly, looked around in disbelief. ‚ÄúOkay, this is insane.‚Äù Around them, Eli‚Äôs belly filled every inch of the cabin. The bed was no longer visible, swallowed by the vast expanse of Eli‚Äôs swollen form. Only Eli‚Äôs head and shoulders peeked out from the massive dome of his stomach, with David and Ryan squished close beside him. Ryan laughed breathlessly, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúHow the hell am I supposed to get back to my cabin? I have to work in the morning!‚Äù David couldn‚Äôt stop laughing, pressing his forehead against Eli‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôre staying here tonight, buddy!‚Äù Ryan snorted. ‚ÄúYeah, but seriously, how am I getting out of here?‚Äù David smirked, wiping tears from his eyes. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry. Eli knows a magic trick.‚Äù Ryan blinked, glancing at Eli. ‚ÄúWait, what magic trick?‚Äù Eli chuckled deeply, his entire belly vibrating with the sound. ‚ÄúNo magic tonight.‚Äù David leaned in, poking Eli‚Äôs bloated side. ‚ÄúOh, come on. Don‚Äôt be a jerk.‚Äù Eli burst into laughter, the whole cabin shaking slightly with the force of it. Ryan groaned, shaking his head but grinning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so screwed.‚Äù David grinned wider, leaning back comfortably against Eli‚Äôs massive side. ‚ÄúNah, you‚Äôll be fine.

He flopped back onto the bed, arms splayed out. ‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs the food?‚Äù The room fell strangely quiet. Eli‚Äôs eyes slowly drifted to the four men who had followed him in. The muscular one‚Äîtall, broad, and smirking‚Äîreached down and gave himself a firm squeeze through his jeans. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry, big guy.

Eli blinked, his brain slowly piecing things together. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ wait, hold on.‚Äù Eli shifted uncomfortably on the bed, scooting back. ‚ÄúI-I think there‚Äôs been a misunderstanding.‚Äù The men only laughed. One leaned in, voice low. ‚ÄúNo misunderstanding, cutie.‚Äù Another pulled his shirt over his head, revealing a tattoo snaking down his chest. ‚ÄúWe know exactly what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Eli‚Äôs back hit the headboard. His breathing quickened. ‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù Eli raised his hands, palms out. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not into this, alright? Let‚Äôs just chill.‚Äù The muscular man climbed onto the bed, crawling toward him. ‚ÄúRelax, little guy. You‚Äôre gonna love this.‚Äù He lunged forward, aiming to grab Eli‚Äôs face. Panic surged through Eli‚Äôs body. Instinct took over. His mouth opened wide‚Äî SHLOORP! The man vanished in an instant. Silence. The other three froze, eyes wide in shock. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù one of them shrieked. Eli blinked, his hand slowly covering his mouth. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ shit.‚Äù The second man bolted, but Eli lunged‚Äî GLURRRP! Gone. The remaining two backed into the wall, their faces pale. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt happening,‚Äù one of them whispered. Eli stood slowly, his belly visibly heavier now, bulging outward. ‚ÄúI told you to back off,‚Äù Eli muttered, voice low and shaky. One man tried to make a run for the door. WHUMP! Eli‚Äôs hand shot out, gripping his shoulder. GLUUUURP! Another gone. The last man collapsed to the floor, scrambling backward. ‚ÄúP-please, man!

Eli slumped back against the bedframe, groaning as he clutched his now massive belly. ‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt what I signed up for,‚Äù he muttered.

Each tilt pushed him closer and closer to the cargo lift. \"He‚Äôs almost there!\" a crewman shouted. One final shift of the ship sent Eli crashing into the massive elevator. THUD! \"YES!\" a security officer cheered. \"Shut the doors, NOW!\" The industrial doors groaned as they slid shut, barely containing Eli‚Äôs enormous body, which filled the entire elevator. \"Send him down!\" The lift rumbled to life, descending deep into the ship‚Äôs technical storage levels.The elevator clanged as it reached the bottom. The doors creaked open, revealing the dark, cavernous cargo hold. Eli let out a miserable groan. \"Ohhh‚Ä¶ my head is spinning...\" A few crew members cautiously approached, stepping over scattered crates. \"Just‚Ä¶ stay here,\" one of them said nervously. \"Please.\" \"Not like I can go anywhere,\" Eli grumbled, giving his massive belly a soft, defeated pat. \"We‚Äôre staying to keep watch,\" another added, clearly terrified. \"Lucky me,\" Eli muttered, slumping further into the cold metal floor.Back on the Bridge, the ship‚Äôs violent rocking began to slow. \"Stabilizers are holding, Captain!\" Captain Reed exhaled in relief. \"Good. Keep monitoring. And tomorrow morning, I want a full investigation. Find out how a passenger could eat enough to nearly capsize the ship.\" \"Yes, sir.\"Meanwhile, in his cabin, David stirred as the swaying of the ship finally stopped. \"What the...\" Still half-asleep, David rubbed his eyes and stumbled into the hall, heading toward the buffet. He froze when he saw the destruction. Tables were shattered, walls were cracked, and trays of food lay scattered across the floor. Eli was nowhere to be seen.

The sounds of shattering glass and splintering wood echoed through the hall. The ship groaned beneath the weight and movement, tilting more with every impact. Up on the Bridge, alarms blared. \"Captain!\" a crew member shouted. \"The stabilizers are failing! We‚Äôre tilting too far!\" \"Impossible!\" the captain barked. \"Dear God,\" the captain muttered.

The metal hull buckled and shattered like paper. Eli's enormous, bloated body burst through the wall, tearing through steel and glass, and was violently flung into the dark, stormy ocean. SPLOOOOOSH! Cold seawater rushed into the gaping hole in the ship‚Äôs side. The entire vessel groaned as it tilted sharply. Passengers screamed, sliding helplessly as the ship leaned further. CRASH! Plates, tables, and even entire rooms were swallowed by the rushing water. \"Abandon ship!\" a crew member yelled, but it was too late. The massive cruise ship tilted completely and began to capsize. One by one, passengers and crew were thrown into the raging ocean, their screams drowned by the roar of collapsing metal. Some managed to cling to floating debris, others scrambled into a few life rafts that were successfully launched. The once-grand ship slipped slowly beneath the black waves, swallowed by the sea. Rain pouring from the dark sky. In the faint glow of emergency lights and distant lightning, thousands of passengers bobbed helplessly in the cold water. Their terrified faces stared at the spot where the ship had vanished. The ocean was eerily still for a moment, save for the sound of sobbing and the distant crash of waves. Crew members in the surviving lifeboats called out through megaphones. \"Stay calm! We‚Äôre getting everyone to safety!\" one of them shouted. \"The worst is over! You‚Äôre safe now!\" People clung to life preservers and drifted toward the boats, hope flickering in their eyes. But then‚Ä¶ A low, ominous rumble echoed beneath the waves. It started as a faint growl, growing deeper and louder, like the sound of a massive waterfall roaring in the distance. The water began to pull. \"W-what‚Äôs happening?\" someone stammered. The surface of the ocean started dragging violently in one direction. \"Oh my God‚Ä¶\" a voice trembled. \"What is that?!\" Then, through the darkness, something massive began to rise. A colossal, pale-pink mass broke the surface, stretching impossibly wide. It was a gigantic belly, glistening in the rain. And above it, an even more terrifying sight‚Äî Eli's enormous, gaping mouth, wide open, inhaling with a monstrous, endless suction. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH! The water rushed toward him, dragging everything with it. \"SWIM!\" someone screamed. But it was useless. Lifeboats were ripped from the surface, spinning helplessly toward the gaping maw. Men, women, and children screamed as they were pulled backward, limbs thrashing. The suction was unstoppable. One by one, the passengers were sucked into Eli's massive mouth, vanishing into the dark abyss. GULP. The lifeboats followed, tumbling end over end before disappearing between his enormous lips. GULP. Crew members, debris, everything was devoured. The howling wind and the crashing waves were drowned out by the relentless, monstrous suction. And then‚Äî Silence. Eli‚Äôs massive form bobbed in the dark water. His enormous belly, now impossibly larger, heaved with a satisfied groan. \"Uuuurrrp.\" Slowly, Eli closed his mouth, letting the last echoes of the storm fade.

But then Eli‚Äôs eyes slowly opened. He blinked, taking in his surroundings. And then he saw them. Rows upon rows of shelves‚Ä¶ all filled with food. His eyes gleamed. GRRRRROOOOAAAAAN. A deep, guttural growl echoed from his massive stomach. Eli smirked darkly, slowly dragging a hand across his bloated belly. His head turned slowly toward the two crew members, his grin widening. The men froze, blood draining from their faces. Eli chuckled lowly. \"Hope you boys aren‚Äôt on inventory duty.\"David burst into the Velvet Wave, the ship's upscale nightclub. Pulsing lights, loud music, and waves of chatter filled the room. He scanned the bar frantically. There. Ryan was behind the counter, mixing drinks. David shoved past guests and leaned over the bar. \"Ryan!\" Ryan jumped, nearly dropping a glass. \"David? What the‚Äî\" \"I need your help!\" David snapped. \"Eli‚Äôs in the cargo hold, and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, but it‚Äôs bad.\" Ryan blinked in confusion. \"Wait, what? How did he‚Äî\" \"There‚Äôs no time!\" David interrupted. \"I need to get down there, but they won‚Äôt let me in.\" Ryan hesitated, glancing at his coworker. \"I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not supposed to leave‚Äî\" David leaned closer, lowering his voice. \"Ryan, he‚Äôs in trouble. And if we don‚Äôt go now, it‚Äôs going to get a lot worse.\" Ryan stared for a moment, then took a shaky breath. \"Cover for me!\" he barked at his coworker, who blinked in surprise. Ryan quickly slipped into the back office and returned with a small access card. \"Boss's key. Let‚Äôs move.\"They rushed through the empty hallways, reaching the smaller staff elevator. Ryan swiped the keycard, and the doors slid open. They rode in tense silence, descending into the lower decks. Ding. The doors opened to a dark, narrow hallway. The distant sounds of something‚Ä¶ wet and heavy echoed from deeper within. Ryan swallowed nervously. \"What is that?\" David didn‚Äôt answer. He broke into a run. They rounded a corner‚Äîand stopped dead in their tracks. The massive cargo hold, once filled with crates, was now half-empty. In its place was Eli. Or rather, Eli‚Äôs gigantic, pulsing belly, rising up like a fleshy mountain. It dominated the space, swelling larger and larger with every heaving gulp. Crates splintered as Eli grabbed them whole, shoving them into his mouth‚Äîwood, metal, and all‚Äîuncaring of what was inside. CRUNCH. GLRK. GROOOOAN. \"Oh my God,\" David whispered. Ryan couldn‚Äôt breathe. His eyes were wide, his face flushed. He was absolutely frozen, but not with fear‚Äîwith fascination. David sprinted forward. \"ELI! STOP!\" But Eli didn‚Äôt hear him. Eli‚Äôs face was flushed, sweat dripping down his forehead as he tore into the remaining crates. His stomach groaned louder with each swallow, stretching tighter, swelling larger. \"Eli!\" David shouted louder. Nothing. Eli was lost in it, devouring everything in sight. His enormous, pulsating belly throbbed with every swallow, taking up more and more space. David ran back to Ryan. \"We have to do something! We need to stop him!\" But Ryan didn‚Äôt move. His eyes stayed locked on Eli, his breath shallow. \"Ryan!\" David grabbed his arm. Ryan flinched, snapping out of it. \"I-I‚Äîwhat do we even do?!\" David‚Äôs mind raced. \"I don‚Äôt know, but if we don‚Äôt stop him, he‚Äôs going to eat the entire ship!\" Eli groaned deeply, grabbing another massive crate and tilting it into his mouth. The cargo hold trembled with the weight of his expanding belly. David stared in horror. \"We need to stop him now.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.davidSprintedThr.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Security room",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.davidSprintedThr.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.theSecurityContr"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"theSoftHumOfTheS1":[["^The soft hum of the ship's engines filled the quiet cabin as warm sunlight streamed through the half-closed curtains.

His fingers tapped idly on the console, the gentle rocking of the ship barely noticeable. All was peaceful. Until the sharp ring of the emergency phone shattered the stillness. Reed's eyes narrowed.

David and Ryan turned to see a full squad of heavily armed security officers sprinting down the corridor, weapons ready, armor clanking. \"MOVE!\" one of them barked, leading the squad toward the cargo hold. David‚Äôs eyes darted around before grabbing Ryan by the arm. \"Hide!\" They both slipped into a nearby maintenance closet, pulling the door shut just as the squad stormed past.

His eyes narrowed. Inside the cargo hold, the scene was beyond comprehension. Eli‚Äôs massive, bloated form dominated the space, his enormous belly stretching high, almost brushing the ceiling.

Reed stepped inside, the air thick with the smell of sweat, metal, and something far worse.

Reed raised the megaphone. \"Passenger Eli!\" his voice boomed, echoing through the cavernous hold. No response. \"This is Captain Reed. You are in direct violation of ship safety protocols. You need to cease what you're doing and cooperate immediately.\" Still, Eli continued chewing, casually wiping his hands on the stretched fabric of his shirt.

Metal groaned and bent as Eli forced his way forward, the twisted wall giving way as he burst into the next cargo hold.

The bridge was suffocatingly tense, the silence broken only by the faint hum of the ship's systems and the distant sound of metal groaning deep within the vessel. Captain Reed stood rigidly, staring at the now-blank monitor. The image of Eli devouring the ship still burned in his mind. Slowly, he turned toward his navigation officer. \"How far are we from the nearest port?\" The officer hesitated, nervously checking the radar and navigation system. \"At our current speed... about one hour, sir.\" Reed‚Äôs jaw tightened. He let out a low, frustrated growl. \"Tch.\" Without another word, Reed turned back to the window, watching the dark waves crash against the bow. \"Hold course,\" he muttered, voice cold and steady. \"And pray we make it.\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.captainReedStood1.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Later on the upper deck",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Cruise.captainReedStood1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Cruise.davidAndRyanSatQ"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"davidAndRyanSatQ":["^David and Ryan sat quietly at the very front of the ship, the cold metal of the railing cool beneath their hands. A soft orange glow stretched across the horizon as the first light of dawn crept over the dark ocean. The ship glided forward, eerily silent except for the soft lapping of water against the hull. But beneath that silence, faint, unnatural sounds echoed from deep within the ship‚Äîlow groans, distant cracks, and the unsettling noise of metal under pressure. Ryan hugged his knees, staring ahead. \"It's too quiet,\" he muttered. \"Shouldn't there be‚Ä¶ I don't know, people out here?\" David didn‚Äôt answer. His eyes were locked on the slowly appearing coastline ahead. Then‚Äî Silence. The strange noises from inside the ship stopped. Completely. David‚Äôs head snapped up, listening. Ryan noticed. \"What? What is it?\" David didn‚Äôt move, ears straining. Then, breaking the stillness, came a deep, thunderous noise. RRRROOOOOOOOOOOHHH... Not metal. Not machinery. Snoring. David blinked. Then he started to laugh‚Äîa sharp, surprised laugh that echoed into the morning air. \"Oh my God,\" David chuckled, covering his face. \"*He‚Äôs snoring.\" Ryan stared. \"He‚Äôs what?!\" David wiped his eyes, shaking his head. \"Come on. Let‚Äôs go see.\"","\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^David and Ryan carefully made their way down the metal staircase. Until it abruptly ended. David stopped so suddenly that Ryan nearly bumped into him. \"What‚Äî\" Ryan began, but the words died in his throat. The staircase just... stopped. They were standing on the very last intact steps, dangling over nothing. Or rather, something. Beneath them, filling the entire hollowed-out shell of the ship, was Eli. His gigantic, bloated body stretched from wall to wall, his enormous belly rising like a massive hill beneath the thin shell of the ship. Every floor, every hallway, every room was gone‚Äîdevoured. Only the outer hull and the top deck remained intact, a fragile shell resting on top of Eli‚Äôs swollen, sleeping form. Eli‚Äôs enormous chest slowly rose and fell, his mouth slightly open, emitting deep, guttural snores. David and Ryan stared in stunned silence. Ryan swallowed hard. \"He... he ate the entire ship.\" David could only mutter, \"Yeah.\" Then‚Äîa low, distant creaking noise. The ship shuddered. David‚Äôs head snapped up. \"Oh no.\" The grinding sound grew louder, metal groaning in protest. \"We‚Äôre hitting land,\" David realized. \"Hold on!\" CRRREEEAAAAK‚ÄîBOOOOM! The ship lurched violently as it scraped onto the shore, sliding forward before grinding to a full stop. Dust and dirt kicked up as the hulking vessel sat awkwardly on the beach. Silence. Then‚Äî Eli snorted, blinking groggily. His massive belly shifted slightly. \"Huh? Wha‚Äî?\" \"Eli!\" David‚Äôs voice echoed. Eli‚Äôs groggy eyes turned upward. He spotted David and Ryan peering down at him. Eli gave a slow, sleepy wave. \"Oh, hey guys...\" David called down. \"Looks like the cruise ended early!\" Eli blinked, then gave a sheepish shrug. \"*Not my fault! It was an accident!\" David rubbed his face. \"Yeah, sure it was.\" Then he smirked. \"Come on. If you let yourself shrink, we can get out of here.\" Eli pouted. \"But my belly‚Äôs never been this big! I wanna enjoy it!\" David raised an eyebrow. \"You can‚Äôt even move right now.\" Eli whined, hands pressed on his massive stomach. \"Ugh, fine.\" David looked at Ryan. \"Hold on. This might get weird.\" Both David and Ryan jumped off the dangling staircase, landing softly on Eli‚Äôs pillowy belly. \"Alright, Eli. Do it.\" Eli sighed dramatically. \"Here goes...\" He took a deep breath‚Äîand then his enormous belly shrank with a series of loud, wet gurgles. GRRRROOOOAAAAAN... David and Ryan wobbled as Eli‚Äôs body deflated, shrinking down, his massive gut slowly pulling back in. Moments later, Eli was his normal, slim self, lying sprawled out on the metal floor. \"That sucked,\" Eli grumbled, patting his now-flat stomach. David smirked. \"Come on, let‚Äôs get out of here.\" They made their way to a nearby emergency hatch, pushing it open.","\n","#","^IMAGE: https:","/#","^The ship lay awkwardly on its side, stranded on a desolate shore. No civilization in sight‚Äîjust sand, grass, and endless waves. David, Ryan, and Eli climbed down onto the soft sand, the salty breeze brushing past them. For a moment, they just stood there, staring at the wreck of the once-grand cruise ship. Then‚Äî GRRRROOOOOWL. Eli‚Äôs stomach grumbled loudly. He blinked, then sheepishly grinned. \"I‚Äôm hungry.\" David and Ryan stared at him in disbelief. Then they both burst into laughter. \"Eli, you‚Äôre always hungry!\" David howled. Ryan doubled over, laughing until tears rolled down his cheeks. Eli chuckled along, shrugging. \"What?
